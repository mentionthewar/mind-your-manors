287,1625 June 30 or later ,two subsidies ,Charles I ,"Parliament was summoned to commence on 17 May 1625, but its opening was delayed until the treaty for the marriage of Charles I with the French princess Henrietta Maria had been completed, and did not formally begin until 18 June 1625.  On 30 June or soon after, a supply of two subsidies was granted to the king, again for the defence of the Palatinate, but parliament was not dissolved until 12 August, after the commons had refused to vote a further supply.  The grant may at least have been made by 15 July 1625, according to a letter in the Wynn of Gwydir collection at the National Library of Wales (ref. 1356), when Sir John Cook, one of the Masters of Requests, was stated to be intending to move the House for more subsidies.  After the dissolution of Parliament, another letter suggests that the attempt would be made to raise money by other means as \'the resolution now is to send forth Privy Seals\' (Wynn of Gwydir 1362).The rates were the same as for the previous subsidy, each to be collected in one payment.  Individuals and corporations were charged 2s.8d. per pound for moveable goods worth £3 or more, and 4s. per pound for lands worth 20s. or more per annum.  Aliens paid double these rates (5s.4d. per pound on goods and 8s. per pound on lands), and if not meeting the minimum requirement, were liable to a poll tax of 8d. per head for each payment.From this date forward, Catholic recusants were to be charged for subsidies at the same double rates as aliens.  They were to be assessed on lands or goods, and if not meeting the minimum thresholds for liability, were, like aliens, to pay a poll tax of 8d. per head.  Recusants were defined as Catholics over the age of 17, or persons aged over 21 who had not attended holy communion for a year.  There was evidently, in some parts, a vigorous reaction to this innovation.  An affidavit sworn by a Warwickshire collector on 26 June 1626 records that there were over 150 persons in his hundred from whom he had been unable to levy the second part of the tax, all but seven of these being recusants assessed \'per poles\' (E 179/259/4).The first subsidy was to be assessed by 30 September, certified at the Exchequer by 20 October and paid by 31 October 1625; the second was to be assessed by 31 March, certified by 20 April and paid by 30 April 1626.An assessment of individuals for the second collection of this grant, dated 29 March 1626, for Coleshill hundred, Flintshire, is in the National Library of Wales, ref. Bettisfield 904.  It appears that instructions for levying the subsidies, or at least the second collection, in Caernarfonshire, were only received by 22 July 1626, according to a letter of that date in the Wynn of Gwydir collection in the National Library of Wales (ref. 1427).  Further letters dated November 1626 seem to suggest that there was general opposition to payment, noting that eleven commissioners had been sent to the Fleet prison for refusing to pay and that \'many of the inferior sort refuse to yield to the royal subsidies\' (Wynn of Gwydir 1442-3).Books containing the names of the collectors of these two subsidies, together with the amounts assessed upon their areas, are now at E 179/283/21-22.(|Stat.

288,1628 June 16 x 29 ,five subsidies ,Charles I ,"Parliament opened on 17 March 1628, but it was not until satisfactory answer had been made by the king to their grievances - primarily his assent to the Petition of Right - that the commons granted him five subsidies.  The subsidy bill was sent to the lords on 16 June and received royal assent before the adjournment of parliament on 29 June.The tax was to be paid in four instalments.  The first two subsidies were to be paid in one payment, and the other three were payable individually.  The rates were otherwise the same as those for the previous subsidies.  For the first payment, that of two subsidies, individuals and corporations would have had to pay 5s.4d. per pound for moveable goods worth £3 or more, and 8s. per pound for lands worth 20s. or more per annum.  Aliens and recusants, paying double these rates, would have had to pay 10s.8d. per pound for their moveable goods, and 16s. per pound for their lands, while the poll tax on those aliens and recusants possessing no estate was 16d. per head.For the single subsidies levied in the second, third and fourth payments, individuals and corporations were charged 2s.8d. per pound for moveable goods worth £3 or more, and 4s. per pound for lands worth 20s. or more per annum.  Aliens paid double these rates (5s.4d. per pound on goods and 8s. per pound on lands), or a poll tax of 8d. per head.These hefty charges were payable over an unprecedentedly short period of time - less than eight months.  The first two subsidies were to be assessed by 30 June, certified at the Exchequer by 9 July and paid by 10 July 1628; the third (second payment) was to be assessed by 20 September, certified by 10 October and paid by 20 October 1628; the fourth (third payment) was to be assessed by 30 November, certified by 10 December and paid by 20 December 1628; and the fifth (fourth payment) was to be assessed by 10 February, certified by 20 February and paid by 1 March 1629.At least one assessment roll for the levy of the first two subsidies was never returned to the Exchequer, that of four of the six hundreds of Nottinghamshire, but is among the Coke-Steel MSS at Trusley Hall, Derbyshire (ref: SR/4).  However, most of the surviving assessments for the levy of these subsidies are among the E 179 documents.From other extant records relating to these taxes, it is evident that payment of the fourth and the levy of the fifth subsidies did not conform to the schedule set out in the statute.  Two paper volumes in the British Library contain assessments for the levy of the first two subsidies in the hundreds of Samford, Bosmere and Claydon in Suffolk (BL, Add MS 21,055, 21,038), and another similar volume records the assessment of Bosmere and Claydon for the third subsidy (BL, Add MS 21,039).  Both books also include rare surviving warrants containing instructions to the local constables for the levy of the subsidy.The latter volume also contains a letter dated 31 March 1629 from the privy council to the Suffolk commissioners explaining that the levy of the fifth subsidy had been delayed in order to lessen the burden on the \'poore sorte\', and to give time for the gentlemen who had attended the 1628 parliament to cool their tempers, and remember that they were only assessed \'half as much as in former times\'.  The commissioners were told to improve their performance in the levy of the last subsidy, complaining that \'the former payments have been collected and retorned with so loose a hand that half of the last subsidy being payable the 10th of December last is not yet received\', and were cautioned against under-assessing.  Documents from the West Riding of Yorkshire indicate that a variety of revised payment dates were authorised, even for different areas within the same county; the collectors for Staincross wapentake were to make payment by 20 May 1629, Agbrigg and Morley by 26 May, and Staincliffe and Ewcross by 5 June (E 179/209/362, 360, 253).  However, another extant original commission, dated 8 January 1629, for the levy of the fifth subsidy in Wiltshire, indicates that no delay was thought necessary there (BL, Add Charter 40,103).A book containing lists of commissioners and collectors for the entire country for all four collections of this tax survives at E 179/283/24. In addition, assessments for the members of the nobility for each of the last two payments of this tax are at E 178/5491.(|Stat.

289,1640 Dec 10 - 23 ,four subsidies ,Charles I ,"Parliament opened on 3 November 1640.  After protests against the raising of \'ship money\', which it claimed to be illegal and unconstitutional, it voted two subsidies on 10 December for relieving the king\'s army and the northern counties; on 23 December it granted an additional two subsidies to be used for the same purpose.  The money was said to be urgently needed, and little time was allowed for its collection.The subsidies were to be collected in two payments, which amounted, in effect, to paying two double subsidies.  The rates, therefore, were the same as those for the first payment of the previous grant of subsidies (the five subsidies granted in 1628).  For each payment of two subsidies, individuals and corporations were to be charged 5s.4d. per pound for moveable goods worth £3 or more, and 8s. per pound for lands worth 20s. or more per annum.  Aliens and recusants, paying double these rates, were to pay 10s.8d. per pound for their moveable goods, and 16s. per pound for their lands, while the poll tax on those aliens and recusants possessing no estate was 16d. per head.  Commissioners appointed to levy the tax were named in the statute.The first two subsidies were to be assessed by 27 February, certified at the Exchequer by 4 March and paid by 10 March 1641; the third and fourth were to be assessed by 1 April, certified by 20 April and paid by 10 May 1641.The dates on which payments were due may, however, have been subsequently altered.  An assessment made in Kent, in which the accompanying certificate specifically relates the document to the two first subsidies granted in this parliament, was not certified until 24 March, and cites a payment date of 8 May 1641 (E 179/128/638).  Accounts from the same county, moreover, show that payment of the first two subsidies was late; E 179/287/11, for example, notes payments received as late as 4 June 1641.  Similarly, the assessment for the first two subsidies in Brixton hundred in Surrey, although making no reference to the payment date, was not certified until 23 March 1641, and not returned to the Exchequer until 5 April 1641.  The certificate of assessment merely states that the money was to be paid over by the high collector \'imediately upon his Receipt thereof unto Robert Bateman and others\' at the chamberlain\'s office at the Guildhall in London (E 179/186/448).  This may be in response to an order of the House of Commons, dated 6 December 1641, that monies from subsidies in arrears should be paid directly into the Chamber of London, and not the Receipt of the Exchequer (E 179/274/47).In addition to the returns among the E 179 documents, the assessment for the first two subsidies in the hundred of Colneis in Suffolk is now BL, Add MS 21,047.  Assessments of the second two subsidies in several hundreds in Somerset are BL, Add Rolls 28, 275 and 28,276.  An assessment of individuals for the last two subsidies for Flintshire is in the National Library of Wales, ref. Brogyntyn Estate Papers TH4/2 (formerly Brogyntyn 7030). A dated assessment explicitly for the first collection of this grant for Montgomeryshire (although sections for Llanfyllin and Mathrafal hundreds are wanting) is in Nottinghamshire Archives, ref: DD.B unlisted, Messrs. Barber and Sons, Solicitors, Mansfield; deeds and documents relating to the Clifton family, owners of property in Montgomeryshire.A bundle of papers relating to the collection of these subsidies - giving, in particular, details of the money collected and that still outstanding as of 14 March 1641 in all counties, and the names of the collectors who had not yet accounted in full - is now E 179/274/1, with further such papers at E 179/321/93-6.

290,1641 May 13 ,two subsidies ,Charles I ,"Parliament was still sitting in the session which had opened on 3 November 1640, and which came to be called \'the Long Parliament\'.  A further two subsidies were granted in view of the danger from the Scots, the act making express mention that it was \'for the further relief of his Majesty\'s Army and the Northern Counties\'.  One contemporary source gives 13 May as the date on which the bill was passed.The two subsidies were to be collected in one payment, and the rates charged, therefore, were identical to those levied in each of the two double subsidies of the previous year (those granted in December 1640).  Individuals and corporations were to pay 5s.4d. per pound for moveable goods worth £3 or more, and 8s. per pound for lands worth 20s. or more per annum.  Aliens and recusants paid double these rates - 10s.8d. per pound for their moveable goods, and 16s. per pound for their lands - while the poll tax on those aliens and recusants possessing no estate was 16d. per head.  Commissioners appointed to levy the tax were named in the statute.Assessments were to be completed by 20 October and certified at the Exchequer by 20 November 1641; payment was due by 1 December 1641.In addition to the returns among the E 179 records, the incomplete assessment of Taunton and associated hundreds in Somerset for both subsidies is now BL, Add Roll 28,277, and the assessment of Colneis hundred, Somerset, is BL, Add MS 21,047.Interim accounts made by collectors of this tax for various counties have been recorded in a paper book.  The first nine folios of this book list the taxpayers whose payment was in arrears, persons exempted from payment for various reasons, as well as the dates on which payments were made to the Exchequer by the collectors, many of which were not received until 1642, 1643, or even 1645 (E 179/266/8).  The book attests to the difficulties of the collectors in gathering this tax.(|Stat. Realm|, V, pp. 79-101; |Two Diaries of the Long Parliament|, ed. M.

291,1642 Feb 8 ,contribution and loan to relieve Ireland ,Charles I ,"On 8 February 1642 an act was passed in the Long Parliament for a \'speedie contribution and loan towards the releife\' of the king\'s \'distressed subjects\' in Ireland.  Murders and massacres of Protestants in the Irish kingdom were denounced in the strongest terms.  Collections for the succour of these unfortunate people were to be made by 1 June 1642 in all the parishes of England and Wales by the churchwardens and overseers of the poor, probably after exhortative sermons were preached in the parish churches.  The names of all contributors were to be recorded in \'notes\', together with the amounts given. These notes, and the money collected, were to be handed over to the high constables of the hundreds, who were to deliver them to the sheriffs.  It was then the responsibility of the sheriffs to bring the notes and money to appointed receivers and treasurers in London before 1 July 1642.In addition to the collections made in the churches, commissioners had also been appointed in Bristol and the Cinque Ports, who were instructed to meet and appoint persons who they \'thinke fitt, and earnestly to move and perswade them liberally to contribute and lend money toward so good a worke\' by 1 March 1642.  The commissioners themselves were enjoined to contribute and lend, so as to set an example to others, and to collect and record all the contributions and loans that they could.  These were to be delivered to the sheriffs with all possible speed, and the sheriffs were to give acquittances for the money received.  All lenders would be entitled to repayment with 8% interest, upon production of such an acquittance.After delivery of the money to the appointed receivers, the funds gathered were to be distributed to the victims by members of both houses of parliament, and instructions were given for the printing and publication of the lists of contributors.  A large measure of publicity had already been given to this fund-raising effort by the printing of this act of parliament in \'books\' to be distributed to the sheriffs, mayors, bailiffs and head officers of boroughs, and to all ministers, parsons, churchwardens and overseers of the poor, for publication in public places, parish churches and chapels.Many lists of collections made in the parish churches survive among the E 179 documents, signed by ministers and churchwardens, which record contributions as low as one or two pennies (see, for example, E 179/249/9, 10, 11).(|Stat.

292,1642 Feb ,"grant of £400,000 ",Charles I ,"In February 1642, during the Long Parliament, parliament voted a grant of £400,000 to Charles I by an act entitled \'an act for the speedy raising and levying of moneys for the necessary defence and great affairs of the kingdoms of England and Ireland and for the payment of debts undertaken by the Parliament\'.  The total sum of £400,000 was divided up and allocated to the individual counties, cities and boroughs, with each required to pay an amount specified in the statute.  Within each county/city/borough, the sums due were to be divided further among the towns, hamlets and parishes, and within these, individuals held to be liable to pay the subsidy were to be assessed and charged sums proportional to the values of their estates, at the discretion of the commissioners.Held liable to pay the subsidy were lords, clergy and laymen with moveable goods to the value of £3 or more, aliens and recusants owning moveable property of any value, or those persons enjoying income from lands held by whatever tenure, or offices or annuities, of 20s. per annum or more.  Only servants earning under £10 annually, or servants of the king earning under £5 annually, were exempt.  The commissioners, all appointed by and named in the statute, were to charge a rate per pound, as in the manner of subsidies, and were to be given their commissions by 10 April 1642.A special feature of this subsidy was the apportionment of the tax between landlords and tenants.  In the case of lands let to tenants for life, a term of years, or at will, and for nearly the yearly value, the person receiving the rent (the landlord) was liable to pay the tax.  If the lands were let at under their yearly value, however, the tax payable was to be apportioned between the landlord and the occupier, in proportions to be decided by the assessors.Aliens and recusants were to be charged double, and if not liable in either category, were to pay a poll tax of 2s.8d.  Half the money received from aliens and recusants, and all that collected from officeholders, was to be set aside as \'surplusage\', and would be used to repay those who had lent money to the crown with 8% interest.  This surplusage was not to count towards the quota allocated to the township or parish, but was in addition to the £400,000 granted.The tax was to be paid in two instalments.  The first payment was to be assessed by 20 May, certified at the Exchequer by 20 June and paid by 20 July 1642, and the second was to be assessed by 20 November, certified by 20 December (1642) and paid by 20 January 1643.  However, a certificate of exemption, drawn up in Surrey in May 1642, gives 20 June as the date on which the first payment was due (E 179/186/446), as do certificates for workers at the Royal Mint (E 179/274/77 Part 3).Although the names of the persons charged and the collectors appointed by the commissioners were to be returned into the Exchequer, the money was to be paid directly to the lord mayor or chamberlain of the treasury of the city of London (the king\'s major creditor).    A letter dated 11 December 1643 from the king at Oxford, presumably relating to the proceeds of this tax and possibly others, contains a request to pay \'some £200 of public money collected in the county of Merioneth as pole money, subsidy money or otherwise\', directly to Sir Orlando Bridgeman (as vice-chamberlain of Chester) at Chester.  This was because the king was \'pressed for money to supply his forces which had come from Ireland to Chester\' (National Library of Wales, Ruthin 1411 (a)).The tax was still being collected during the Civil War.  Several tax collection documents dating from the Civil War period refer to the tax as the \'royal subsidie\' (E 179/313/2, E 179/249/14 and E 179/249/17).  Sussex collectors\' affidavits sworn in March 1646 testify that attempts to bring in the first instalment of the money had only just been abandoned there.  One collector was too afraid to distrain the Earl of Northumberland, \'hee being a Peere of the realme and a member of the high Courte of parliament\', even though the Earl\'s steward had refused to pay on his behalf (E 179/395/18, m 9).  The collectors of the tax in Surrey encountered similar problems: an affidavit dated 21 November 1645 reveals that William, Lord Monson, a member of parliament, had likewise intimidated another collector (E 179/186/446, m 1).  An affidavit containing a long list of uncollectable debts was sworn by a Nottinghamshire collector of the tax on 25 November 1647 (E 179/163/12); three Oxfordshire affidavits of non-distraint were sworn at the Exchequer in February and May 1650 (E 179/304/3, E 179/395/11); and certificates attesting to a collector\'s inability to distrain were issued before the mayor of Coventry as late as June 1650 (E 179/194/319).In addition to the assessments returned by the commissioners in individual counties, a paper book of interim accounts of the collectors of both payments of this tax from various counties, including London, exists (E 179/266/8).  The book lists delinquent taxpayers and persons exempted from payment, and records the dates of payments made by the collectors into the Exchequer.  It also contains warrants for allowances and other memoranda.  An original assessment of Trowbridge and three hundreds in Wiltshire for the first payment of this subsidy, and another of Taunton and associated hundreds in Somerset for the second payment of this subsidy, and never returned into the Exchequer, are now BL, Add MS 30,989; Add Roll 28,278.An assessment of individuals for the first collection of this grant, dated 6 June 1642, for the rape of Pevensey, Sussex, is at C 103/153.  This is in good condition and legible, apart from some small patches of soiling.  It consists of eight rotulets and covers the hundreds of Loxfield Camden (rot 1), Rotherfield (rot 2d) and Loxfield Dorset (rot 4d).Although no documents for this tax for Anglesey survive among the records of TNA series E 179, a warrant dated 14 November 1642 to collect the second payment of this grant (stating that the first collection had been paid) relating to Anglesey is among the Presaddfed papers 484 (i) in the Archives Department, University of Wales: Bangor.  For Denbighshire, there is a warrant dated 30 May 1642 to levy presumably the first collection, for Rhuthun hundred, listing either assessors or collectors for each township, in the National Library of Wales (Crosse of Shaw Hill collection 1092).  Although assessments were made for the parishes of Llanfair [Dyffryn Clwyd], Llanelidan, Derwen, Clocaenog and Efenechtid, either under that warrant, or a warrant for the second collection, only the assessments for Llanfair, Llanelidan, Clocaenog and Efenechtid survive among the Crosse of Shaw Hill collection (1119-22).The form of assessment of this tax was to become the standard form of assessment for the weekly and monthly assessments ordained by parliament and collected during the Civil War and under the Commonwealth.|Stat.Realm|, V, pp 145-167)enrolled account: E 359/73, rots 30-35 ",Origin  Granted,"1st: 1642 July 20, 2nd: 1643 Jan 20"
293,1642 April or earlier ,subscription loan for the reduction of the Irish rebels ,Charles I ,"In early 1642 parliament passed a statute authorising the institution of a speculative scheme to raise funds for the reduction of the rebels in Ireland.The scheme offered as repayment to all those who agreed to lend money a share of the two and a half million acres of land which would be confiscated from the Irish rebels after the crown\'s victory.  The minimum contribution was £6 from Irish (loyalist) settlers, who were also promised two years of remission of export duties on livestock.  Everyone in England who promised money (£10 minimum), and paid the first half immediately and the other half within six months, would be allotted a proportional share in the confiscated lands.  In England, the deadline for the initial contribution was 1 May 1642, and in Ireland, it was 1 July 1642.Subsequent amendments extended the dates by which participants could enter the scheme, and allowed corporations and Dutch Protestants the opportunity to participate as well.(|Stat.

295,1642 Dec 8 ,weekly assessment ,Charles I ,"An ordinance passed in parliament on 8 December 1642 provided for the taxation of several counties for the support of the army of the parliamentary forces.The ordinance is devoid of collection details, with much discretionary power given to the deputy lieutenants of the counties, who were nominated and appointed by parliament.  They had authority to levy within their counties, \'from time to time, as the occasion shall require\', requisite sums of money.  These were to be apportioned by them among the \'several hundreds and corporations\' within their respective counties, \'according to the usual proportions in other public rates\'.  They also had the power to nominate assessors and appoint collectors to levy and collect the rates.The deputy lieutenants were also given the authority to issue warrants to the collectors for distraint and sale of goods of those persons who refused to pay the sums assessed against them.  In cases where no distress was to be had, collectors would commit the defaulters to imprisonment in the county gaol without bail until the sums were paid.It is not known how long this ordinance was in force, although a collection document recording the levy of weekly assessments in Kent suggests that it may have lasted for 13 weeks (see E 179/249/17).(|Acts and Ordinances|, I, p 47) ",Origin  Granted,
296,1643 Jan 30 ,contribution and loan to relieve Ireland ,Charles I ,"An ordinance for \'new loans and contributions...in Ireland\' passed by parliament on 30 January 1643 was, in effect, a continuation of the authorisation to solicit contributions and loans granted on 8 February 1642, but it also incorporated elements of the subscription loan introduced in April 1642.  Like the latter scheme, the loan was to be repaid with the confiscated lands of the Irish rebels.  Dutch Protestants were invited to lend and contribute as well.  Loans, moreover, would be repaid with 8% interest.  Treasurers were appointed to receive the money at the Guildhall in London.Like the contributions and loans ordained in February 1642, collection was to be made by churchwardens and overseers of the poor, after sermons preached in the parish churches and chapels on \'the next Lords day\'.  The names of lenders and contributors, and the amounts given, were to be recorded in schedules, which were to be taken to the Guildhall and transcribed into a register, so that lenders could be given satisfaction after suppression of the rebellion.(|Acts and Ordinances|, I, p 70) ",Origin  Granted,
297,1643 Feb 24 ,weekly assessment ,Charles I ,"An ordinance \'for raising money for the maintenance of the Army by a weekly assessment\' was passed in parliament on 24 February 1643.  This ordinance, itself based on the principles established in the grant of £400,000 in 1642, set out the basic terms of what was to become the standard form of taxation thereafter, until the Restoration of the Stuart monarchy in 1660.Taxpayers were to be assessed on every pound\'s worth of goods, as were all owners/occupiers of land and officeholders, and made to pay according to the same rate.  Aliens and recusant Catholics were to be assessed at double the rate levied on native-born individuals.  Each county, city and borough was charged with providing a specific weekly sum; all of these sums are listed in the ordinance, together with the names of the commissioners appointed for each county, city and borough.  These commissioners were to form committees to appoint assessors and collectors.Payment was to be made weekly for three months, and any evaders caught would be charged treble.  Londoners were to receive a rebate of £3,000 from the £10,000 with which they were charged to pay each week, for their own defence.The assessment was to be completed by 26 February 1643, and the first payment was due on 1 March 1643.  An ordinance of 4 March 1643 entitled \'Ordinance to explain some things in the one for the weekly assessment\' provided for an appeals process for those persons who felt themselves over-assessed.  This ordinance also mandated that no one could be assessed to pay more than 20% of their estate, nor more than £10 per week.  The date of this latter ordinance has been cited in the records of its levy, on at least one occasion, as the date on which the ordinance authorising the weekly assessment was made (E 179/187/467, m. 1).A supplementary ordinance of 3 May 1643 complained that the tax was not being either assessed or collected efficiently and quickly enough, and appointed two extra commissioners in each county, issuing them with more specific instructions.  Assessors and collectors who had been dilatory or negligent were to be fined, the names of members of divisional committees who had not put the order into execution were to be returned to parliament, and the new appointees were to make a weekly report to the Speaker which would incorporate not only what they had achieved, but any suggestions they might \'conceive advantageous for this service\'.There appears to have been some local variation in the operation of the levy.  In Kent, for example, the weekly assessment was in effect initially for six weeks, and it was not until after the collection made of these six weeks had been received by the high collector on 24 June that the tax was continued for a further seven weeks, payable within the next three days (E 179/313/7).It is possible that there may have been some opposition to this or other contemporary assessments, at least in Denbighshire, or to.  Following a meeting at Shrewsbury, a petition was made to Lord Capel (presumably as lieutenant-general of North Wales, Cheshire, Shropshire and Worcestershire), dated 3 July 1643 or later, in which the unknown writers stated that \'they cannot approve of other subsidies for the maintenance of the army than what is already agreed upon by anticipation of the king\'s rents, as the people are \'extremely exhausted by former taxations and much wanting money for want of sale of their cattle\' (National Library of Wales, Crosse of Shaw Hill, 1123).(|Acts and Ordinances|, I, pp 85-100, 139-141) ",Origin  Granted,"1st: 1643 Mar 1, 2nd: 1643 April 15"

The committees were to appoint assessors who would assess all such persons on their assets, and charge a rate accordingly.Only those possessing lands worth £10 or more per annum, or owning goods worth £100 or more, were liable to be assessed and charged.  The assessors were not to ask for more than 20% of the yearly income of those assessed on their lands, or 5% of the value of those assessed on their personal estate of cash, stock, goods and debts.  Hence the tax came to be known, and is often referred to, as the \'fifth and twentieth part\'.  The process of assessment, whereby the parish constables were instructed to provide the assessors with estimates of taxable estates, was open to corruption, and was necessarily slow.  The ordinance also provided for a means of appeal by those who felt themselves incorrectly assessed, and many availed themselves of this right. Payment was to be made by 24 June 1643, and on 1 June 1643 further members were added to the committees appointed to levy the tax, in order to speed up collection.

The army was to consist of 6,600 \'horse\', 1,000 dragooniers and 14,400 \'foot\'.  Although the date of promulgation of the ordinance is cited as 17 February in the |Acts and Ordinances|, the measure was always referred to in the many extant documents relating to this tax as the act passed on 15 February (see, for example, the printed receipts at E 179/112/681).  Each county was charged with providing a specific monthly sum, to be raised by a monthly assessment of the inhabitants of the county.  Parliament also appointed committees in each county to execute the terms of the ordinance.The committees were to meet at least twice a week, to divide themselves into smaller groups corresponding to the county divisions and hundreds, and appoint assessors.  The assessors were to assess \'all persons having any reall or personall estate\' within the limits of their area, according to \'the most equall and usuall Rates for levying of money\', and the \'true yearly values\' of their estate.  Within six days of the completion of the assessment, the assessors were to deliver one copy of their assessments to the committee.  The committee was to have three copies of the assessment made, one of which they were to deliver to the collectors appointed by them to collect the tax, the second of which was to be given to the receivers of the tax appointed by parliament, and the third of which was to be passed on to the Committee of the Accounts of the Kingdom, before whom oath was to be made by the accountant, \'as hathe been accustomed in the Court of Exchequer in the case of the Estreates of Subsidies\'.Collectors were given the power to levy distresses and sell the goods of those persons who refused or neglected to pay the amounts assessed against them, and to imprison and sequester where no distraint could be levied.  They also had authority to \'break open any House, Chest, Trunk, Box, or other thing, where any such Goods are\' and to call upon the Trained Bands for assistance whenever they encountered resistance.  As in the grant of £400,000 of 1642, payment of the assessment was to be apportioned between the landlord and tenant, and the tenant had the right to withhold rent from his landlord in compensation for payment made by the tenant in the landlord\'s stead.  There was a right of appeal before the committee for over-assessment, and there were financial penalties of up to 40s. for negligent assessors or collectors.The collection of the monthly rates began on 1 February 1645 and continued until 1 December 1645.  The communal assessment and appointment of collectors for Reigate and Tandridge hundreds in Surrey (E 179/187/471), and the receipts issued to the high collector for Reigate hundred (E 179/187/472), indicate that the payments under the initial ordinance were collected at three monthly intervals, beginning in May 1645.

320,1645 Feb 21 ,monthly assessment for Scottish army ,Charles I ,"On 21 February 1645 parliament granted a monthly assessment to be levied in all counties for four months, to raise £21,000 to maintain the Scottish Army.  The ordinance refers back to two previous attempts to raise this sum.  Initially, the sequestered estates of recusants and royalists were to provide the funds.  When these provided inadequate, the northern counties were ordered to levy a monthly assessment for this purpose, although no record of this ordinance, said to have been passed on 9 March 1644, has been found.  It was because these counties proved too impoverished that the assessment was extended to all counties, and the original ordinance revoked.  The ordinance was to remain in force for four months from 1 March 1645, and to be collected monthly.  The amounts to be levied in each county were laid down in the ordinance.On 20 June 1645, in view of the fact that the £21,000 sought under the ordinance of 20 February 1645 had not been raised, it was ordained by parliament that anyone willing to advance the sum of £31,000 would be repaid with 8% interest.  On 15 August 1645, a continuation of the 20 February 1645 ordinance was granted, to run for four months from 1 July 1645.The declared account of R.

333,1647 June 23 ,"monthly assessment of £60,000 to maintain the armies ",Charles I ,"On 23 June 1647 Parliament passed an ordinance which required all counties to levy a monthly assessment of £60,000, this total sum to be apportioned among the counties, as specified in the ordinance.  The tax money collected was intended to be used to maintain the armies under Fairfax\'s command, and to pay for the transportation and wages of forces to fight in Ireland, although the preamble to a subsequent ordinance (that of 16 February 1648 for raising £20,000 a month for the relief of Ireland) noted that none of this money could be spared for Ireland.  The ordinance took effect retrospectively, from 25 March 1647, and was to last for one year.  The commissioners to levy the tax in each county were nominated in the ordinance, and the procedures for assessment and collection were the same as for the levy of previous assessments to maintain Fairfax\'s army.No payment dates were specified in the ordinance, although it is clear from various receipts and assessments, and from a subsequent ordinance, that the tax was collected in three instalments (E 179/128/678; E 179/191/395-399; E 179/183/544A Part 3 f  26 suggests instalments of 2 months, 4 months and 3 months).  However, in Haverfordwest, at least, the assessments were made every three months (see the documents noted below).  On 24 December 1647, it was noted that the first nine months of this tax were in arrears and an ordinance was passed, entitled \'An Ordinance concerning Free-Quarter\', in which it was mandated that the first six months of these arrears be paid by 15 January 1648, and that once these arrears had been discharged, the levy of the previous three months of the tax (the period between 25 September and 25 December 1647), would be remitted.  The tax, in effect, became a nine-month tax, the last period of levy being from 25 December 1647 to 25 March 1648 (E 179/191/398).The receipts from these assessments were to finance the disbandment of all but the core of the army at the end of the conflict, which was referred to as the \'disbanding of all Supernumerary forces\', and the procedure for payment of arrears was set out in an ordinance passed on 24 December 1647.Surviving documents for this tax for Pembrokeshire and Haverfordwest consist of assessments of communities for the first three months (E 179/224/527, E 179/224/528, E 179/224/531 and E 179/321/67) and for the second three months (E 179/224/524 - E 179/224/526).  However, a very fine series of assessments of individuals, including occupations and in some cases, relationships, for Haverfordwest exists among the Haverfordwest Borough Records in Pembrokeshire Record Office.  The documents cover the following periods:25 March 1647 to 25 September 1647 (Haverfordwest Borough 1927-8)25 December 1647 to 29 September 1649 (Haverfordwest Borough 1929-36) with associated accounts and orders (Haverfordwest Borough 617, 1937-9)25 December 1649 to March 1650 (Haverfordwest Borough 618) and25 March 1651 to 25 December 1651 (Haverfordwest Borough 1940 and 622), with associated accounts, 1648/9 to 1658 at Haverfordwest Borough 665, 1942-8, and orders, c.1647-51, at Haverfordwest Borough 1949-50.

The ordinance also appointed commissioners in each county to levy the tax.The assessment was to last for six calendar months, beginning 1 February 1648.  The rates to be levied were at the discretion of the commissioners, although it is stated that all lay and ecclesiastical individuals and corporations were liable to be assessed on their real and personal estates, as well as on debts due to them.  The same rules applied for the apportionment of the tax payable between landlords and tenants.  Aliens and recusants were to pay double the rates assessed on native-born persons.Anyone willing to advance money on the security of the ordinance was offered repayment with 8% interest.

382,1625 Sept ,privy seal loan ,Charles I ,"After the dissolution of Parliament on 12 August 1625, on account of disagreement over the provision of subsidies over and above the two already granted, a letter dated 15 August 1625 in the Wynn of Gwydir collection in the National Library of Wales appears to suggest that an attempt would then be made to raise money by other means as \'the resolution now is to send forth Privy Seals\' (Wynn of Gwydir 1362).In September 1625, measures were taken through the lords lieutenant to ascertain the names of persons able to lend money to the king.  The deputy lieutenants were to advise the members of the privy council, and certificates and schedules for payment were to be drawn up and sent to them.  The council was then to send privy seal letters for loans to these individuals, payable in twelve days, and repayable in eighteen months.  Any assessments about which complaints were made were to be investigated, and mistakes were to be verified, on oath, by the lieutenants or other persons \'worthy of credit\' (SP 16/6, nos. 70, 128).  However, in 1626, at least in Caernarfonshire, the opinion on repayment of the loans was that \'The Privy Seals once paid in are past recovery\' (Wynn of Gwydir 1417).Many excuses were given, and in consequence, payment of the privy seals does not seem to have been pressed; the money raised on them did not come in until early in the next year.  Some of these printed privy seal letters, most without any evidence of having been paid by the addressees, survive among the records of the Privy Seal Office.  The wording of the letter is similar to that issued by James I in 1611, asking for sums \'which few men would deny a friend\', in accordance with the \'precedents and customs of former times\'.  All of the letters are dated 2 or 3 December 1625 (E 34/58).Evidence for contributions from Wales is found among the papers in the Wynn of Gwydir collection at the National Library of Wales:  a letter dated 8 March 1626 states that \'the Privy Seals for the forced loan are to be sent down shortly into Wales\'; the contributions from Justices of the Peace would be between £40 and £10, and that £550 was requested from Caernarfonshire and £740 from Denbighshire.  However, a suggestion was made to petition for exemption, on grounds of poverty and also on grounds of not yet having completed payments towards the \'Prince\'s mise\', presumably on the accession of Charles I (Wynn of Gwydir 1395).  By June 1626, at least the tenants of the lordship of Rhuthun had determined to make such a petition (Wynn of Gwydir 1417).  A subsequent letter of 30 April 1626 shows that 38 privy seal letters were sent to Caernarfonshire (Wynn of Gwydir 1403), and there is evidence that some were paid (Wynn of Gwydir 1421) and that some may not have been (Wynn of Gwydir 1422).  A list of names of collectors for Caernarfonshire, Cardiganshire, Carmarthenshire, Denbighshire, Flint and Merioneth is also extant (Wynn of Gwydir 1403).(Dietz, |English Public Finance, 1558-1641|, pp 227-228) ",Origin  Imposed,1st: 1625 Sept - 1626 Feb
383,1626 July 7 ,benevolence ,Charles I ,"On 7 July 1626, following the dissolution of parliament on 15 June without a grant of supply, the privy council wrote to the justices of the peace of the shires, complaining that although the commons had reached a \'unanimous agreement\' to grant the king four subsidies and three fifteenths and tenths, some members had obstructed the grant.  The justices of the peace, therefore, were to levy a benevolence.  They were instructed to meet with the local \'subsidymen\' (those persons assessed to pay subsidies), persuade them of the need to contribute, and collect the money.  The threat of a Spanish invasion, widely publicised by the privy council in the summer of 1626, was also meant to induce contributions of \'a supply equal to five subsidies\' (SP 16/31, no 30).The people proved reluctant, and circumstances were such that it was not possible to use coercive measures in the levy of a benevolence.  No measures were put in place, therefore, for proceedings against defaulters, and only a few JPs sent in their names.  The privy council tried to garner support for the levy by writing letters to individual peers, asking them to set an example to others by contributing, but most of the letters did not reach them until late August.  There were two serious tactical errors in the instructions sent to the JPs, which account more than anything else for the failure of the benevolence, however.  The suggestion that the benevolence was to be an alternative to the grant of supply by parliament provided a worrying precedent.  The second problem was that the meetings with the \'subsidymen\' were allowed to take place in large groups, which reduced the opportunities for JPs to employ their personal influence.  Although a second set of letters sent to the JPs on 26 July corrected these defects, most of the shires had already held their meetings and decided not to contribute (SP 16/31, no 31).Only four counties - Middlesex, Surrey, Warwickshire and Carmarthen - contributed a total of £948 16s.4d. (E 401/2442).  Several of the remaining counties had been prepared to give only small sums, but were forestalled from making their contribution by a royal proclamation cancelling the levy.Dietz, |English Public Finance, 1558-1641|, p 235; R.

384,1626 Aug 5 ,privy seal loan ,Charles I ,"On 5 August 1626 collectors were appointed to raise a new loan, and on 14 August 1626 the king wrote to his council authorising it to draw up a list of those fit to pay, based on the lords lieutenants\' returns of 1625.  The council had already begun to issue privy seals, however, to a small number of judges, office-holders, and wealthy and other country gentlemen (many of them notably enemies of the duke of Buckingham), and assessed them to pay amounts of between £100-£2,000 (E 401/2586, pp 1-81, 459-477).The same printed privy seal letters were used to levy this loan as had been issued in 1625, but with the \'first\' year of Charles I\'s reign crossed through and \'second\' written above it.  The year \'1625\' was also altered to \'1626\'.  Two such letters survive among the records of the Privy Seal Office, both dated 10 September; neither of them is noted as having been paid (E 34/58).Very little money was received and on 22 September 1626, the loan was suspended by proclamation.(Cust, |The Forced Loan|, pp 37-38) ",Origin  Imposed,1st: 1626 Aug - Sept 22
385,1626 Sept 13 ,forced loan ,Charles I ,"On 14 September 1626 the privy council decided to levy a forced loan, prompted by the emergency situation brought on by the defeat of the king of Denmark in September 1626.  A set of instructions was sent to preachers on 20 September 1626, and commissions for the levy of the loan were issued on 23 September and 20 October 1626, copies of which exist in various manuscripts (BL, Stowe MS 325, fos 136-141; BL, Cotton MS Titus B.IV, fos 384-394v; BL, Egerton MS 2651, fos. 82-84v; SP 16/36, no 42).  These instructions are discussed in Dr. Cust\'s book (pp 47-48).  A book which Dr. Cust has referred to as a list of the commissioners appointed to levy the loan exists at C 193/12/2.   In two Suffolk documents, E 179/183/555A Part 2, an assessment towards the loan for the hundreds of Babergh and Cosford, and Part 4, an assessment for the hundred of Lackford with Exning, some of the instructions are recited; it is stated that one part of the indented assessment was to be handed to the collector, who was to pay the monies raised into the Exchequer, and the other part was to be delivered to the Privy Council, with the collector\'s bond, according to His Majesty\'s instructions.The commissioners were to use the books compiled for the last subsidy in their assessments, and it was suggested that those persons who had been assessed as having, for example, £100 in land, should lend £100, while those possessing the same amount in goods were to lend 100 marks, and so on, pro rata.  People were to be encouraged to attend meetings held by the commissioners, and each person was to be taken aside confidentially and \'persuaded\' to pay.  Those who could were to pay within 14 days; the rest could pay in two equal instalments, the second payment being due on 20 December 1626.  On 8 November 1626 further instructions were sent to the commissioners exhorting them to make their collection with all speed, and informing them that any contributions which had been made to the benevolence or the privy seal loan were to be counted towards the payment of this forced loan.  Reimbursement was to be made, moreover, of the surplusage of any payments made in excess of the loan.  The names of all defaulters were to be certified to the privy council, and they were to be examined on oath to determine whether they had attempted to dissuade others from lending either publicly or privately (BL, Harl MS 365, fos 4-5v; SP 16/36, no 43).  The privy council waited over three months before asking most of the taxpayers to contribute and in the meantime tried to persuade those over whom it had influence to set an example by contributing.  Council members met personally with potential lenders.Several assessments and other returns for the loan survive in the E 179 and SP 16 classes of documents, many of which are discussed by Dr. Cust, whose book analyses in detail the levy of the loan in Essex.  Other papers relating to the levy of the loan in Surrey, and not cited by Dr. Cust, are in the Surrey Record Office, Guildford (LM 1513, 1516/2, 1516/4, 1517).Resistance to the loan, which has been termed \'the first outbreak of large scale disobedience to the royal government\', is legend.  A large number of gentry refusers present in London in 1627 directed attention to the severe measures used to enforce the loan, and in November 1627 the issue came to a head with the case of the \'Five Knights\', when the legality of the loan was challenged at law.  These refusers had sought a public trial of the latter issue, together with the grounds of their imprisonment.  The subsequent decision against the \'Five Knights\' provoked public outcry, and was to become a key issue in the 1628 parliament.  A petition to the king in 1627 from loan refusers \'long\' imprisoned gave their reasons for refusing to lend, citing medieval statutes, parliament rolls and charters of liberties, in their claim that the forced levy of a loan was illegal (BL, Add MS 12,496, fos 102-103).  Proceedings of the council in April 1627 against the loan refuser William Coryton are in BL, Harl MS 365, fos 6-8v. The loan began to be collected in October 1626 and, by 27 November 1627, £154,292 had been paid into the Exchequer (SP16/84, no 89).  Final Exchequer accounts show that total receipts at the Exchequer amounted to some £184,820, while £82,244 15s.1d. never reached it, being disbursed in the counties for the expenses of billeting, coat and conduct, and purveyance.  The total sum collected may have been as high as £267,064 15s.11d. - not far short of the £275,000 raised by the five parliamentary subsidies granted in 1628 (E 401/2322-5; SP 16/85, nos. 76, 77). The high yield was achieved by strong coercive measures, such as the threat of military impressment, forced billeting of soldiers and imprisonment.  Its very success was due to it being a \'forced loan\' in the true sense of the term.(Cust, |The Forced Loan|, pp 4-5, 47-48, 51, 92-93, 99-100, 260-283; Cust, \'Commissioners for the Forced Loan of 1626-7\', |Bulletin of the Institute of Historical Research|, vol.

386,1628 Feb 12 ,ship money ,Charles I ,"The idea of extending to other counties what had been an extraordinary revenue levied only on the port towns and maritime counties for defence purposes in times of national emergency, and levied by writ as a separate request for aid, which was traditionally received into the Treasury of the Navy rather than the Exchequer, was first proposed in 1603, a few weeks before the death of Elizabeth I.  The plan was scuppered in the event of her death.Not every county was to be asked to contribute in 1603, but in 1628 an ambitious attempt to levy ship money on the entire country was made.  On 12 February 1628 the council sent letters to the sheriffs, enclosing two letters: one to the justices of the peace from the council, and another from the king, for the information of the sheriffs, deputy lieutenants and justices.  The latter instructed the sheriffs to call together the justices of the peace and make known the government\'s intentions, justifying the need for the tax by the deteriorating political situation in Germany and France, and stating that the ship money was intended to be in anticipation of subsidies expected to be granted from the parliament which had been summoned to meet on 17 March 1628.  It was to be explained that the urgency of the situation had forced the king to ask for immediate money.The ship money was expected to raise the equivalent of three subsidies - a sum of £173,411 - and each county, city and borough was assessed and charged with levying a specific amount, with the heaviest burden to fall on the west country (esp. Devon).  Later attempts to levy ship money would be loosely based upon these assessments.  Ironically the Cinque Ports were exempt because this tax was marketed as a form of subsidy (from which they were traditionally exempt), and \'was so described by contemporaries\'.The collectors were to be appointed by the justices of the peace and the tax was to be administered under the direction of the sheriff, who continued to be the key figure in the assessment and collection of ship money throughout the 1630s.  The ship money was to be collected between 12 February and 1 March 1628.Four days after the council sent its letter and that of the king into the country, a proclamation was issued, abandoning the scheme.(K. Sharpe, \'The Personal Rule of Charles I\', in his |Politics and Ideas in Early Stuart England| (London, 1989), p 115; R.J.W. Swale, \'The Ship Money Levy of 1628\' |BIHR| 50 (1977), 165-170, cf.

387,1634 Oct 20 ,ship money ,Charles I ,"On 20 October 1634, writs were sent to the town corporations and the sheriffs of maritime counties asking for a levy of ship money.  The ships, fully-rigged with men and ammunition, were to be ready to sail from Portsmouth harbour by 1 March 1635, and the towns could contribute either money or ships.  Within 30 days of the date of the writ, a meeting of at least nine mayors of the towns of Kent and Sussex was to be held to assess the charge, and in default of such an assessment, the county sheriff was to assess the charge.The self-assessment of towns proved problematic and writs ordering the levy in the following year suggested a quota of ships to be contributed by each town.  The total amount asked for in 1634 was £80,609, of which only £79,586 was received.  A copy of an order to levy the ship money dated 20 October 1634 is in the National Library of Wales (ref. Bronwydd 7185), together with a neatly tabulated document, giving a list of the towns, counties or areas concerned, the number of ships to be raised by each by 1 March 1635 (one each, except in the case of London and York, which were to raise 2), with their burdens and numbers of men, and the amount to be levied (ref. Carreglwyd Group I 660).  This clearly confirms the quota system thought to have been applied to this levy.The declared accounts of this money are among the papers of the Audit Office and the collected and uncollected totals from each county are printed by Gordon (p 155).  The ship money levies of 1634-1640, and their total annual yields, are comprehensively treated in A.A.M. Gill, \'Ship money during the personal rule of Charles I: politics, ideology and the law 1634 to 1640\' (Unpubl. Ph.D. thesis, Sheffield Univ., 1990).(|CSP Dom, 1634-1635|, p 295; Sharpe, \'Personal Rule of Charles I\', p 115; M D Gordon, \'The Collection of Ship-Money in the Reign of Charles I\', |TRHS| 3rd ser., IV (1910), p 143)declared account: AO1/1702/76 ",Origin  Imposed,1st: 1635 March 1
388,1635 Aug 4 ,ship money ,Charles I ,"For the first time, the ship money was levied on all counties, and the number of ships to be rigged by each town were apportioned by the council, although beyond these allocations, the assessment was to be made by the sheriffs.  The sheriffs were enjoined to make careful assessments, \'according to the houses and lands within the county, or to follow other public payments &quot;most equal and agreeable&quot; to the inhabitants\'.  Disputes over assessment was the biggest problem with the tax before its legality was called into question in 1639, but the ship money generally yielded a far higher amount of revenue than the subsidies had.Like the ship money levy of 1634, the assessment was made in terms of ships to be provided, but the localities had the option to pay money instead. Not only were the sums raised to pay for the ship itself, but also the wages and equipment of all people involved in its construction, and the costs of manning and provisioning the ship for twenty-six weeks after its completion. The formula used by the council to make the county allocations, based on each county\'s usual revenue from subsidies, can be followed in documents at E 179/276/2 and E 179/276/20, which show the calculations. Writs to the collectors were issued on 4 August 1635, and the ships were to be ready at Portsmouth on 1 March 1636.Most of the surviving documents for ship-money in E 179 appear to relate to the various attempts to collect arrears outstanding from this first nationwide levy. From December 1636 onwards, the government ordered an investigation into arrears across the country; the files returned by the sheriffs of fourteen counties survive at E 179/275/1-8 and 10-15. Documents from Herefordshire show how the collection of these arrears then progressed. The original writ of investigation for Herefordshire was issued in March 1637, and returned with a list of defaulters (E 179/275/6). Consequently, a writ was issued to the Herefordshire sheriff in June 1637 (E 179/272/28), together with copies of the schedules returned from the original investigation, ordering the collection of the outstanding sums. This achieved little, and on 28 November 1637 another writ was issued (E 179/273/1), then a third, probably in the spring of 1638 (E 179/248/10; the writ is missing but the schedule survives). There may well have been more. Each time the sheriff recorded on the schedule the few individuals who had paid or died, and these were omitted from the next set of schedules. This pattern is repeated in most counties for which documents survive, and writs for different counties were often issued on the same day. For instance, there appears to have been a concerted effort in November 1637, with writs being issued to a number of counties on 28 November. The collection of arrears from this tax appears to have been a priority of the government, so much so that the Warwickshire sheriff was forced to produce a second schedule in 1637 when the government deemed the first to be unacceptable (E 179/275/14); from the size of the second schedule, their suspicions were justified.C.G. Bonsey &amp; J.G. Jenkins (eds.), |Ship Money Papers and Richard Greville\'s Note-Book|, Buckinghamshire Record Society, xiii (1965) details the administration of this tax in that county, and serves as a useful guide to the tax as a whole. It also contains a translation of the original writ to the county (pp.1-3), and transcriptions of other documents produced by the collectors.Although no documents for any of the levies of ship money for Wales survive in series E 179, material exists elsewhere, providing evidence of assessment, collection and attitudes to the levies in Wales, and in some cases, England as well, since two assessments for the constabulary of Willesley, Derbyshire, 1635, which may relate to this levy, are in the National Library of Wales (Mayberry 6989-90).Other material includes a warrant to make an assessment for ship money, dated 19 September 1693, to the sheriffs of Montgomeryshire, Denbighshire, Flint, Caernarfonshire, Anglesey and Merioneth, in the National Library of Wales, Peniarth Estate collection, CA54.  The date of this warrant would predate warrants for the levy of 1639, therefore the document may relate to delayed collection of an earlier levy.Extant material also includes assessments of individuals, one dated 28 December 1637, for places in Talybolion hundred, Anglesey, found among the Presaddfed papers (480) in the Archives Department, University of Wales: Bangor.  A warrant to collect monies for the providing of a ship, dated 8 May 1639, to the constables of Llanddeusant parish, Talybolion hundred, is also among the Presaddfed papers (481).  The exact levies to which these documents relate is not certain; they may relate to those of 1637 and 1638, therefore details have also been included in the notes for those levies.Two documents in the National Libary of Wales also provide evidence of collection of ship money in Flintshire, presumably for this levy.  They are a warrant dated 24 October 1635, to collect £68-2s-4d in the hundred of Prestatyn, as part of the sum of £738-4s-8d assessed on Flintshire and a receipt dated 2 January 1636 for part of the amount assessed on the hundred of Prestatyn, both in the Peniarth Estate collection, CA52 and CA53.A letter dated 5 March 1640 concerning abuses in the collection of ship money is in Flintshire Record Office, among the Gwysaney MSS, ref. D/GW/2120 (formerly NLW Gwysaney Group I 37; with a copy in the National Library of Wales, ref. NLW Facs. 371).  This letter might relate to one of the later collections, such as that of November 1639, but might also relate to delayed collection of one of the earlier levies. A receipt dated 18 February 1637 from the Treasurer of the Navy to the deputy sheriff of Monmouthshire for £1,500 for ship money, \'following a royal writ dated 12 August last\', is also in the National Library of Wales, ref. Tredegar Box 105/114.  This may relate to the levy of 1636, but might equally relate to arrears of the levy of 1635.  A copy of a warrant dated 20 December 1636 relating to the levy in the hundred of Isaled, Denbighshire, is also in the National Library of Wales (Plas Nantglyn 4, f. 11); this might possibly relate to the collection of arrears, as outlined above. Evidence for slow collection, probably of the levy of 1635, in Merioneth is found amongst the Clenennau Letters in the National Library of Wales.  An order from the Privy Council to the sheriff of that county dated 12 July 1637, concerns the arrears of ship money due on \'1 March last\', which were to be paid to the Treasurer of the Navy by the beginning of Michaelmas term (Brogyntyn MSS (Clenennau Letters and Papers) 502 (NLW Film 1035)).  By 31 October 1637, an amount of £16 was still outstanding, but this had been paid by 28 December 1637, as an acquittance from the Treasurer of the Navy had by then been obtained (Brogyntyn MSS (Clenennau Letters and Papers) 505-7 (NLW Film 1035)).  These arrears might partly have arisen from an assessment for the hundred of Edeirnion, Merioneth, sent from the constables of that hundred, to the sheriff of the county under cover of a letter dated 13 November 1636, which also describes the procedure of assessment (Brogyntyn MSS (Clenennau Letters and Papers) 497 (NLW Film 1035)).Papers in the Wynn of Gwydir collection also in the National Library of Wales also chart the progress of tensions caused by the ship money:  on 8 June 1641, reports of the judges being threatened in case they did not force payment of the ship money were sent back to Caernarfonshire, and on 6 July, the news of the judges\' impeachment for doing so reached that county (Wynn of Gwydir 1686, 1689).  An order dated 6 August 1641 to sheriffs to pay any ship money still in their hands to the justices at the next sessions, who were to repay those who had contributed also survives (Wynn of Gwydir 1691).(Sharpe, \'Personal Rule of Charles\', pp 115-116; Dietz, |English Public Finance, 1558-1641|, p 275n, cf.

In 1636 there were some alterations to the quotas, and the sheriffs were for the first time required to sign the assessments.The writs were issued in September 1636, but were altered in the following month.  It was again implicit that the ships were to be ready at Portsmouth on 1 March 1637 (PC2/46/378).A warrant to collect £416 in Merioneth towards one ship from the counties and corporate towns of north Wales, dated 9 October 1636, is in the National Library of Wales, Brogyntyn MSS (Clenennau Letters and Papers) 496 (NLW Film 1035).(Sharpe, |Personal Rule of Charles I|, p 557; |CSP Dom, 1636-1637|, p 152) ",Origin  Imposed,1st: 1637 March 1

393,1639 Aug 20 ,contributions toward the defence of the kingdom ,Charles I ,"The \'contributions toward the defence of the kingdom\' levied upon the nobility in lieu of feudal service due for the Scottish war may represent the last attempt to summon a feudal levy and impose a scutage.  On 20 August 1639, proclamation was ordered to be made to all men holding land of the king \'by grand sergeantry, escuage or knights service\', that they were to perform their services against the Scots, \'according to their tenures\'.  They were accordingly to assemble by 20 September.N.B. Lewis suspected, however, that the real intention behind this \'feudal levy\' was to solicit contributions towards the campaign.  He pointed out that the king had written on 19 August to the lord lieutenants of certain counties, informing them that he would accept fines in lieu of service.

Convicted popish recusants had to pay double the above rates.  All other persons over the age of 16, and not in receipt of alms, were to pay a poll tax of 6d. per person. The money was to be paid to the sheriffs, or in London, to certain designated persons (who would issue them with a certificate of receipt), or outside of London, to certain specified members of parliament (also issuing a certificate).  Those who did not pay within four days of the date on which the money was due were to be distrained at double the rate, and were liable to other penalties as well.Anyone who lent £100 in advance of the levy of the tax, before 20 July 1641, would be repaid with 8% annual interest.Residents of Northumberland, Newcastle upon Tyne, Berwick-upon-Tweed and County Durham were exempt from assessment in those places, but were liable for assets worth £20 or more held in other places.  Residents of the cities of York, Hull and Carlisle, upon whom soldiers were billeted, were to be excused altogether.The statute does not specify a date on which payment was due at the Exchequer, however, but it may be assumed from the title of the act, that payment was due as soon as practicable after assessment.  A receipt issued upon payment of this tax in Essex was dated 19 August 1641 (E 179/391/2).  A Surrey collector\'s appointment relating to this tax, dated 28 July 1641, specified that the money was to be paid \'uppon Tuesday the third day of August next ensueinge...by eight of the clock in the morning, at the signe of the Castle in Kingston uppn Thames\' (E 179/384/17).An assessment for Nassaburgh hundred in Northamptonshire is now Northamptonshire Record Office, NPL 560.

They were also given authority to commission officers, and to cover the costs of ammunition and other incidental expenses by means of a local assessment.  Those inhabitants who defaulted on their obligations to provide dragoons and soldiers could be fined up to 40s., which sums were to be applied towards the costs of the militia.

It ordered that the churchwardens and overseers of the poor in London, Westminster, Southwark, Middlesex, Essex, Kent, Surrey and Hertfordshire should make collections in their parishes of \'Gifts, and Charitable Benevolences of all and every person\' to relieve this distress.  The sums collected were to be set down \'in words at large, and not in figures\' and subscribed by the minister, parson, vicar or curate of each parish as well as by at least one of the churchwardens.

All plate was to be compensated at the rate of 1s. per ounce, and reimbursement of contributions of horse and arms would be at a rate of 2s.6d. per day, from the date on which their receipt at the Guildhall in London was recorded.  Members of both houses of parliament were especially enjoined to contribute, and both contributions and subscriptions for contributions were to be accepted from them.No payment dates were specified, but the urgency of the situation was stressed.

465,1642 Nov 26 ,assessment of non-contributors in the London area ,Charles I ,"On 26 November 1642 parliament ordained an assessment of those who had not yet contributed to any of the previous voluntary money-raising exercises.The ordinance appointed a commission of prominent London citizens, which included the mayor and several aldermen, who were given authority to appoint six assessors in every ward.  These assessors were to be instructed to make enquiries as to \'any that remaine...that have not contributed upon the Proposition\', and then assess them for a fitting contribution, \'according to their Estate\', provided that the amount imposed did not exceed the twentieth part (that is, one-fifth) of their total assets.The ordinance ostensibly applied only to London, Westminster and their suburbs, and the borough of Southwark.  In Westminster and Southwark, the burgesses were to appoint the assessors to make the same enquiries and assessments as in London, but the tax may also have been levied in the \'adjacent counties\' referred to in a further, clarifying, ordinance of 29 November (see, for example, the \'noncontributing cesse\' levied in Kent - E 179/313/75, 78).The assessors were also to be responsible for collection of the money, which they were then to deliver to the Guildhall, London.As stated in the ordinance of \'explanation\' of 29 November, collection of half the amount assessed was to be made within six days of notification made to the individuals liable, and the second half was to be collected after another six days.  Distress and sale of goods was to be used against anyone who refused, and those without distrainable assets were to be imprisoned until they paid.  A further amending ordinance of 14 December provided remedy for unfair assessments, which was available six days after payment had been made, by appeal to the commissioners who had appointed the assessors.  The aggrieved party would be re-assessed, and, if applicable, an abatement and a rebate of overpayments would be made.  An ordinance of 8 February 1643 strengthened the procedure for levying distresses against those who had been assessed but had failed to pay, and also set a deadline for payment (11 February 1643), after which the collectors would \'repair to the houses of the persons assessed\', demand payment and take note of whether sufficient distresses were to be had.(|Acts and Ordinances|, I, pp 38-41, 48-49, 77-79; |LJ|, V, p 594) ",Origin  Granted,

The relief was a weekly charge levied on all the parishes of England and Wales, collected by the churchwardens and high constables, and paid by the latter to a treasurer appointed by the county justices of the peace.  The treasurer was then to disburse the relief in the form of quarterly pensions to the soldiers.  The total amount leviable in each parish was fixed by this act at between 3d. and 2s.6d. per parish (or chapelry), and like the Elizabethan reliefs on which the tax was modelled, the actual amount to be charged to each parish was to be decided by the county justices of the peace (or in the case of London, by the mayor, recorder and aldermen).  The assessment of individual parishioners was to be made by the parishioners themselves, and in the event of disagreement, was to be adjudged by the churchwardens and constables in the first instance, and by local justices of the peace in the second.  The tax was payable in the ten days before the quarterly sessions of the peace, beginning at Easter last past and ending the following Easter, and the penalties for default and negligence of taxpayers or collectors were the same as those fixed by the statute of 1601.  Under the present act, treasurers were given discretionary powers to disburse extra relief, where it was deemed necessary.

It mandated further that whether or not there was still a necessity for the tax to remain in force was to be decided by the justices of the peace at the next quarter sessions.  This ordinance also stipulated that the Clerk of the Peace in each county keep a book showing all monies collected and disbursed.The last ordinance was repealed under the Commonwealth on 7 May 1649, and an \'act for the relief and imployment of the poor\' in London was enacted in its place.(|Acts and Ordinances|, I, pp 938-940, 997-998, 1055-1056; II, pp 104-110) ",Origin  Granted,1st: 1647 April 18

The committee was also given authority to levy a charge on inhabitants \'constantly dwelling within the lines of communication\', from time to time, at their discretion, or persons \'who have any stocks going in trade\' within the said limits and have departed, for the finding and maintenance of \'horses with riders and furniture, at their proper charge, for the defence of the city and parts adjacent\', provided that no one person be charged with providing more than two such horses and riders.

No privileged persons, apart from members of parliament, were to be exempted from this act, which was to remain in force for two months only.Two ordinances of 31 July 1647 confirmed the penalties for default specified above and gave further power to the Committee of the Militia of London to seize and list horses for the service of the \'king, parliament and city\'.

The privy seals were ordered on 25 January, and the heaviest demands were to be made upon those who had refused to pay the forced loan.A few of the privy seal letters, none of them bearing any note of payment or repayment, survive among the records of the Privy Seal Office.  All are dated either 8, 9 or 10 February 1628.  Printed in the |civilite| typeface, the tone of the letter was distinctly less friendly than that of the text of the privy seal letters sent in 1625 and 1626.  Emphasis was laid on the reciprocal ties of the monarch to \'take care\' for the \'safeties and welfare\' of his subjects, and the duty of his subjects \'to ayde and assist\' him in their \'common preservation\', as well as the well-established tradition of the monarch calling upon his people for \'private helps...upon urgent necessities\'.  The insufficiency of the king\'s funds, despite the sale of his jewels, plate and lands, and the aids and loans given by his subjects was cited, and also the duty of the king\'s subjects to show obedience and loyalty \'towards the surety of [the king\'s] person, defence of [their] country, maintenance of religion and our allies\'.  Payment was requested within 10 days, and repayment was promised within a year.  The recipient was enjoined \'in no wise to faile hereof\' (E 34/58).There was opposition to this loan led by the Earl of Bedford and the Earl of Devonshire, and the levy of the loan was ultimately abandoned when a new parliament was summoned to grant the king supply in March 1628.(Cust, |The Forced Loan|, pp 83-85; Dietz, |English Public Finance, 1558-1641|, p 244) ",Origin  Imposed,

922,1625 July 8 x Aug 12 or earlier ,three clerical subsidies ,Charles I ,"Meeting in convocation at Westminster College (formerly Westminster Abbey) on 8 July 1625, the clergy of the southern province granted the king three subsidies of 4s. in the pound, over three years, to which the northern clergy presumably gave their assent soon after. The grant was confirmed in the parliament which sat between 18 June and 12 August 1625.The subsidies were to be paid in six equal instalments (of 2s. in the pound) over three years.  As before, the subsidy was to be levied on income from all manner of benefices and clerical offices, and paid by every archbishop, bishop, dean, archdeacon, prebendary, provost, master of college, master of hospital, parson, vicar and all other members of the clergy enjoying any spiritual promotion or other temporal possessions annexed to the same spiritual promotions.  Parsons, vicars and other clergy whose benefices were valued at less than £6 13s. 4d. per annum were wholly exempt.  Vicars whose benefices were valued at less than £8 per annum were also wholly exempt, and vicars whose benefices were valued at between £8 and £10 per annum were to pay only 13s. 4d. for each whole subsidy (that is, 6s. 8d. for each payment).  Only benefices worth more than £10 per annum, therefore, were to pay the full rates.The subsidy was to be levied according to the valuation made for first fruits and tenths, with deduction made for payment of the tenth part of their income, under the act of first fruits and tenths.  The clergy were to be taxed for the subsidy, therefore, on nine-tenths of their income.  No one promoted to a benefice or office, who had compounded or was to compound for payment of first fruits between 1 June 1627 and 1 June 1630 was liable to pay any of the subsidies in the first year after his composition.  Allowable deductions from the taxable value of new bishoprics, deaneries, cathedral or collegiate churches, or colleges, etc. were whatever portions of their revenue had been given for the maintenance of poor men, school masters, ushers, grammarians, choristers, petty canons, vicars choral, readers of divinity, singing men, vergers and other necessary and daily officers or ministers, and the expenses of rebuilding or repairing of any cathedral or collegiate churches or colleges.  These deductions were to be certified to the Exchequer, upon due search and examination by the bishop or archbishop (or by the dean and chapter, in the event of a vacant see), by 31 August each year (for subsidy payments due on the previous 1 June) and by 28 February each year (for subsidy payments due on the previous 1 December).  Any parson, vicar or other clergyman paying a pension (i.e., to stipendiary priests) which was not deducted from the assessment for his liability for these subsidies was allowed to retain for his own use the amount of it for which he was taxed.  Stipendiary priests themselves were not liable to pay the subsidies.Exempt from payment of the subsidies were any benefices, almshouses, hospitals or grammar schools belonging to any college within the universities of Oxford or Cambridge, the college of Westminster, to Eton College or Winchester College.  No cathedrals, churches or other ecclesiastical places which had previously been charged with maintaining anniversaries, obits, lights, lamps etc. in chantries, which were now in the king\'s hands, were to pay any tax on any part or portion of income from such chantries to which the king was now entitled or possessed of, but were to have deduction and allowance made to them in their assessment for the subsidies accordingly.  The same was to be true of concealed lands, which had previously been in the hands of cathedrals or churches, but were no longer in their possession. Lay farmers or other lessees of forms of spiritual income were likewise liable to pay the subsidies on behalf of their landlords, unless they could produce any writings, covenants or bonds that showed otherwise.  Spiritual possessions were not subject to payment of fifteenths or other taxes granted by the laity, however.The subsidy was to be collected by the bishops and their appointees in every diocese, or by the dean and chapter in the case of a vacant see, and they were to certify the names of all deputy collectors appointed.  The subsidies were to be paid twice yearly on 1 December and 1 June, beginning on 1 December 1627 and ending on 1 June 1630.  The revenue collected each year on 1 June was to be paid into the Exchequer by the following 31 August, and that collected each year on 1 December was to be paid into the Exchequer by the following 28 February (but on 29 February in 1628).  Each collector was to receive an acquittance upon payment of the tax money, for which he was to be charged only 4d.Collectors were empowered to compel payment of the subsidies from any defaulters by sequestration of the fruits and profits of their benefices or offices, after lawful warning given to them, to release them from any ecclesiastical censures under which they had been placed, once their payment had been received, and to revoke all process made against them.  Collectors or bishops could sell goods distrained from defaulters, remitting the money received for them to the Exchequer.  After a first refusal to pay, the defaulter was liable for the collector\'s costs in coming, going and demanding the tax, and after a second refusal, he was bound to pay the fourth part of the subsidies in addition to the amount that he had been assessed to pay.  In the event of obstinate and persistent refusal to pay, the defaulter would forfeit one year\'s profits of his benefice or office, 50 days after due warning. Collectors were to be discharged of any amounts that they certified to the Exchequer by 31 August (for payments due on 1 June) and by 28 February (for payments due on 1 December) each year (but on 29 February in 1628) that they were unable to collect from defaulters, and the form and exact wording of this certificate was specified in the subsidy act.Within four days of the collector\'s arrival at the Exchequer with the tax money, the appointed receiver was to receive the money and deliver a receipt to the collector or his deputy for every payment made.  Auditors of collectors\' accounts were to hear and audit their accounts within six days after a request to account had been made, and were to give bonds to this effect.  For every default or delay in the accounting procedure, the auditor was to be fined £10, half of which was to be paid to the collector so inconvenienced and half to the crown, upon complaint made to the treasurer, under-treasurer or chief baron of the Exchequer.  The offending auditor was to be imprisoned until paying the forfeited sum.  All acquittances given by collectors to taxpayers were to be honoured at the Exchequer, and if they were not, then the offender was to be subject to the same penalties as above specified.  Collectors were to be allowed 6d. of every pound for the charges of collection, carrying and paying in of the subsidies, and were to receive an acquittance at their final accounting each year, for which acquittance the accountant would be charged the sum of 3s.4d. to be paid to the clerk for writing it.(|Stat Realm|, V, pp 3-9 (1 Charles I, c. 5); P.

924,1640 May 16 - June 8 ,clerical benevolence ,Charles I ,"The grant made by convocation in 1640 provoked a constitutional crisis. Throughout the reigns of the first two Stuart kings bills confirming grants of clerical subsidies had received only perfunctory attention in parliament, but this changed when the clergy chose to act independently. Their actions were subsequently exploited by Charles I in his struggle with parliament.There was already hostility to convocation when parliament assembled in April 1640 because of fiscal support which had been offered to Charles I by the bishops. On 17 April the convocation of Canterbury province and parliament held a joint session in which Archbishop Laud urged the clergy to grant the king a generous subsidy. In the session of convocation held on 22 April, the archbishop announced that the bishops had decided to offer the king six subsidies and directed the lower clergy to give their assent to this proposal; they complied later that same day. A committee was formed on 25 April to draw up the subsidy book so that it might be approved by parliament as quickly as possible. On 5 May parliament was dissolved prematurely, before the clerical grant could be confirmed by statute.This dissolution should normally have been followed by the dissolution of convocation as well, which would have meant that the clerical subsidy would not have been confirmed, and hence, not levied. Archbishop Laud, having never presided over convocation before, did not realise that convocation could only be dissolved by royal writ and proceeded to dissolve the assembly on his own authority. When informed that royal assent was needed for this dissolution, he raised the matter with the king, expecting him to grant his approval, but was instead refused permission. Because Charles I wanted the clerical subsidy, he had decided that convocation should continue to meet to grant him the supply which he required. A royal commission was issued for this purpose, and on 13 May Archbishop Laud invited the assembled clergy to press on with the subsidy grant.  Three days later, on 16 May, the lower clergy approved the grant of a \'free benevolence or contribution\' - the 1587 benevolence providing the precedent for such a grant - which did not require parliamentary confirmation. The terms of the \'benevolence\' were identical to those of the subsidy which had been proposed before the dissolution of parliament - six subsidies at 4s. in the pound, over six years. Even the preamble to the grant was identical to that made in 1628. It was a clerical subsidy in all but name. At last, after the canons of convocation received the king\'s approval, a royal writ dissolved the Canterbury convocation on 29 May. Meeting on 8 June, the convocation of the northern clergy approved an identical benevolence.The subsidies were to be paid in twelve equal instalments (of 2s. in the pound) over six years. As before, the subsidy was to be levied on income from all manner of benefices and clerical offices, and paid by every archbishop, bishop, dean, archdeacon, prebendary, provost, master of college, master of hospital, parson, vicar and all other members of the clergy enjoying any spiritual promotion or other temporal possessions annexed to the same spiritual promotions. Parsons, vicars and other clergy whose benefices were valued at less than £6 13s. 4d. per annum were wholly exempt. Vicars whose benefices were valued at less than £8 per annum were also wholly exempt, and vicars whose benefices were valued at between £8 and £10 per annum were to pay only 13s. 4d. for each whole subsidy (that is, 6s. 8d. for each payment). Only benefices worth more than £10 per annum, therefore, were to pay the full rates.The subsidy was to be levied according to the valuation made for first fruits and tenths, with deduction made for payment of the tenth part of their income, under the act of first fruits and tenths. The clergy were to be taxed for the subsidy, therefore, on nine-tenths of their income. No one promoted to a benefice or office, who had compounded or was to compound for payment of first fruits, was liable to pay any of the subsidies in the first year after his composition. Allowable deductions from the taxable value of new bishoprics, deaneries, cathedral or collegiate churches, or colleges, etc. were whatever portions of their revenue had been given for the maintenance of poor men, school masters, ushers, grammarians, choristers, petty canons, vicars choral, readers of divinity, singing men, vergers and other necessary and daily officers or ministers, and the expenses of rebuilding or repairing of any cathedral or collegiate churches or colleges.Exempt from payment of the subsidies were any benefices, almshouses, hospitals or grammar schools belonging to any college within the universities of Oxford or Cambridge, the college of Westminster, to Eton College or Winchester College.  As before, stipendiary priests do not appear to have been liable to pay the subsidy.The subsidy was to be collected by the bishops and their appointees in every diocese, or by the dean and chapter in the case of a vacant see, and they were to depute sub-collectors by 1 August in each year, who were to be given the power to compel payment of the tax by ecclesiastical censure, that is, by suspension, interdict, excommunication, or by sequestration of the fruits and provents of benefices or offices or other legal remedies.  The names of the sub-collectors were to be certified to the archbishops of Canterbury and York by the relevant bishop (or dean and chapter) by 1 September each year.  The subsidies were to be collected twice yearly between 1 October and 1 November and between 1 April and 1 May, beginning on 1 October 1640 and ending on 1 May 1646.  The revenue collected each year by 1 November was to be paid to the bishops by the following 15 December, and that collected each year by 1 May was to be paid to the bishops by the following 15 June.  Collectors were to be discharged of any amounts that they certified to the bishops by 15 June (for payments due by 1 May) and by 15 December (for payments due by 1 November) each year that they were unable to collect from defaulters, and the form and exact wording of this certificate was specified in the subsidy act.  The bishops, in turn, were to certify the names of any such defaulters to the archbishops by 15 January (for payments due by 1 November) and 15 July (for payments due by 1 May).Accounting was to take place before the archbishops and three other bishops or other appointed receivers by 15 February (for payments due by 1 November) and 15 August (for payments due by 1 May).  Each collector was to receive an acquittance, after payment of the tax money to the receivers, by 20 February (for payments due by 1 November) and 20 August (for payments due by 1 May).  No collector was to be asked to pay more than 4d. for each acquittance, nor more than 2d. for any other type of certificate (for ecclesiastical censures).  Collectors were to receive 1d. for every 6d. collected for their costs.  In the event of any disputes or ambiguities regarding the collection of the benevolence, the interpretation and arbitration of the archbishop and appointed bishops or any two of them was to settle them.There were questions about the legality of the continuation of convocation after the dissolution of parliament not only among members of parliament but also among the clergy themselves, many of them realising that parliament might take its revenge if the king lost his struggle with the parliamentarians.  So it proved.  When the king was forced to summon another parliament later in the year, a Commons\' committee was formed on 9 December 1640 to examine the actions of convocation in May 1640.  A week later the Commons passed an unanimous resolution which declared the benevolence illegal and discharged the clergy from their obligation to pay.  With the onset of civil war, convocation was suspended, only to be reinstated after the restoration of Charles II in 1660.  This subsidy, therefore, was the last to be granted by the clergy until 1663.(P.

944,1634 July 17 ,six subsidies granted in Ireland ,Charles I ,"In the summer of 1633, Lord Wentworth arrived in Ireland as Lord Deputy, to lead the government there and to investigate the many concerns of that government, including the state of the army, the church, crown finances and crown title to lands.Having first gained the permission of Charles I, Wentworth proposed to hold a Parliament, envisaged by him to consist of two sessions: the first to grant a supply of money, and the second, for the redress of grievances.  He intended to raise three subsidies of £30,000 each over three years, which would go towards clearing crown debts and creating a surplus.  These subsidies, it was hoped, would be granted before the session to consider grievances and requests for reform, many of which had previously been presented by the Irish, including the old English, to the English government in 1628 as the \'Instructions and Graces\'.Parliament opened at Dublin Castle on 14 July 1634 and on the fourth day of the session, four subsidies were granted, followed by a further two.  These were to be levied on all persons spiritual or temporal, excepting only orphans, minors under 21 years of age and the personnel of Trinity College, Dublin.  The four subsidies were each to be paid in two collections, the first within six months after the first day of the session and then, at six-monthly intervals thereafter.  The two subsidies were to be paid in the same way, concurrently with the first two of the four subsidies.Those with goods worth £3 or more per annum were to pay 2s 8d per pound for each subsidy, or 1s 4d for each collection; aliens were to pay double these rates.  Those aliens who did not qualify and who were over the age of 7years old were to pay a poll tax of 8d per head per subsidy, or 4d per collection.  Those with lands worth 20s or more per annum were to pay 4s per subsidy or 2s per collection, and again, aliens were to pay double these rates.In this way, it has been noted that Wentworth raised the amount of each subsidy to over £40,000 from the commons, adding £6,000 from the nobility and £3,000 from the clergy (Bagnall, p. 226).  Although the Commons agreed to arrange assessment themselves, the assessments of the last two groups were made by the government, and Wentworth\'s letter of 1 August 1635 giving an outline of arrangements for collection, payment and use of the proceeds of the subsidy assessed upon Irish noblemen resident in England exists among the English State Papers (Cal. S.P. Dom., p. 310).  The taxation of non-resident nobility, the subject of Article 37 of the Graces, had been put forward during the first session of Parliament (Clarke, p. 85), but evidently this section of society was included in the Acts granting the six subsidies. Surviving records for this tax in series E 179 relate to precisely that group and are evidently copies of assessments for all six subsidies transmitted to the Exchequer from Ireland by order of royal writs (E 179/70/145A).Having achieved a supply of money over and above that originally proposed, however, in the second session of the Parliament, the petitions and grievances of the Irish were dealt with in summary fashion by Wentworth.  This caused much discontent among the old English, shown by one pamphleteer, citing Wentworth\'s reaction to their hostility.  This was clearly one of disdain, as he was supposed to have said that the Irish \'had more already than their six little subsidies were worth and that they were not to expect their [act of limitation] being the principal thing they desired\' (Clarke, pp. 87-8).|Calendar of State Papers Domestic 1635|, p. 310; |Calendar of State Papers Ireland Charles I 1633-1647|, p. 66; |Statutes at Large Ireland|, vol II 10 Charles I 1635 - 15 Charles 2 1662, pp. 2-18; R.

188,1661 July 8 ,free and voluntary present ,Charles II ,"The second parliament of Charles II opened on 8 May 1661, and on 8 July 1661 royal assent was given to the \'act for a free and voluntary present to his Majesty\'.  This tax was granted by parliament to aid the king in \'this suddain exigencie as a testimony of theire affections...and in ease of the poorer sort of [the king\'s] subjects\'.  Commissions were to be issued under the Great Seal to appropriate persons in the counties, cities and towns who were \'fit for the receiving of such subscriptions as [the king\'s] subjects shall voluntary offer\'.  The commissioners were directed to organise themselves into hundreds, rapes, wards, etc. and hold meetings which were to be publicised.  They were to appoint receivers who would collect and receive the tax, and give acquittances free of charge.  The subscriptions were only to be returned to the Exchequer with the payment.  No commoner was to contribute more than £200, and no peer more than £400.  The tax was payable upon the issue of the commissions, which were to be in effect only until 24 June 1662.  All process issuing from the Exchequer against defaulting subscribers had to take place within two years of passage of the act.Commissions appear to have been issued throughout August 1661, with separate commissions appointed to take subscriptions from the laity and clergy. The commission for Surrey was issued on 8 August, while those for Radnorshire and Northumberland were dated 16 August, and commissioners for Carmarthenshire, Cardiganshire and Pembrokeshire were appointed on 19 August 1661 (E 179/263/43; E 179/321/72; E 179/265/18). The original commission issued on that same day for Pembrokeshire and Haverfordwest survives in Pembrokeshire Record Office (HDX//33/1).Commissions to take subscriptions from the clergy seem to have been issued at the same time; that issued to the bishop of Durham and other members of the Durham clergy is dated 16 August 1661 (E 179/277/13). However, the commissions for the dioceses of Oxford and Bangor are dated 27 August and 5 September 1661 respectively.The returns for Surrey are instructive as to how the tax was levied locally. Meetings of the commissioners were held in the substantial towns of the hundreds throughout the months of September and October, and less frequently in November and December 1661 (although the commissioners in Cardiganshire sat in February 1662), at which all liable contributors appeared before the commissioners and either \'presented and paid\' their contributions on the spot, or \'subscribed\' to pay specified contributions by certain dates, normally within six to eight weeks.  After all the monies promised were paid, the subscription lists were annotated as paid, often with the date of payment, and returned to the Exchequer (E 179/258/28).In addition to the many returned lists of subscribers in the E 179 class, schedules of subscriptions of the clergy of the diocese of Winchester are at E 178/6447, the diocese of London at E 178/6664, the diocese of Chichester at E 178/6665 and the diocese of St Asaph at E 178/6666, while schedules of the laity in the county and city of Kingston upon Hull are at E 178/6583 and in the city of Chester at E 178/6145. A paper book listing the subscriptions taken by the commissioners in the hundred of Blackbourne in Suffolk at a meeting at Ixworth on 17 October 1661 is now BL, Add MS 21,036.BL, Lansdowne MS 805, fos. 68-74, contains the account of John Clutterbooke, esq., commissioner for collection of this tax from members of the nobility.  The account lists the contributions of the peers, in hierarchical order, and gives the dates of payment, ranging from 13 July to 7 August 1662.  A second list in the same account gives details of those members of the nobility who had not paid their subscriptions.  His certificate as collector, containing a list of subscribers and non-subscribers, is at TNA, PRO 30/24/34/21.Other accounts rendered by collectors, as well as schedules of arrears and defaulters from various counties and dioceses, often giving reasons for non-payment, survive throughout the E 179 series.The tax produced a net yield of about £229,000.(|Stat.

348,1660 Aug 29 ,income or poll tax for disbanding and paying armed forces ,Charles II ,"The first parliament of Charles II opened on 25 April 1660.  On 29 August 1660 royal assent was given to a bill to enable the \'speedy disbanding and payment of the army and navy\'.  The money was to be raised by an income tax graduated according to rank, occupation or office held, and on the basis of income enjoyed from lands and goods.  Tax commissioners for each county were appointed and named in the statute.  The rates to be levied were as follows:|Noblemen|:  dukes, £100; marquesses, £80; earls, £60; viscounts, £50; barons, £40.|Eldest sons of noblemen, aged 21 or older|: dukes, £60; marquesses, £50; earls, £40; viscounts, £35; barons, £30.|Knights and esquires|:  baronets, £30; knights of the Order of the Bath, £30; knights bachelor, £20; esquires, £10.|Professional men and clergy|:  serjeants-at-law, £20; parsons and vicars possessing estates of clear value of £100 per annum, 40s; doctors of civil or canon law and advocates, £5; judges and commissioners in the courts of admiralty or of the probate of wills, £20; doctors of physic, £10.|Londoners|:  lord mayors, £40; sheriffs and aldermen, £20; deputy aldermen, £10; town clerk, £20; common councillors, £5|First 12 livery companies in London|:  masters, £10; wardens, £6.13s.4d; liverymen, £5; yeomen, £3.|Dyers, brewers, leathersellers, girdlers, stationers, woodmongers, upholsters, apothecaries, pewterers, tallow-chandlers, armourers or saddlers|:  masters, £6; wardens, £5; liverymen, £3; yeomen, £1.|Barbers, surgeons, white bakers, wax-chandlers, cutlers, butchers, carpenters, painters, cordwainers, coopers, scriveners, brown bakers, turners, or innholders|:  masters, £3; wardens, £2; liverymen, £1.|Founders, curriers, masons, bricklayers, joiners, plasterers, weavers, fruiterers, marblers, embroiderers, poulterers, cooks or plumbers|:  masters, £1; warden, 15s.; liverymen, 10s.|Bowyers, fletchers, blacksmiths, bottlemakers, woolpackers, farriers, paviers, loriners, glaziers, clerks or watermen|:  liverymen, 5s.Freemen of any company in London, 1s.Hackney coachmen, 1s. per hackney coach and pair of horses kept.|Aliens|:  merchant knights, £40; merchants below the rank of knight and trading at sea, £10; merchants trading on land, £5; householders practising a trade, 10s.|English merchants in London|:  not freemen, £10; factors, 40s.Aldermen in any city in England or Wales below the degree of knight or esquire, £5.|Officers of the Court of King\'s Bench|:  prothonotary, £100; clerk of the crown, £20; custos brevium, £40; marshall, £50; master of the rolls, £60; clerk of the rules, £10.Warden of the Fleet, £50.|Officers of Chancery|: clerk of the crown, £40; clerk of the hanaper, £40; master of the Subpena Office, £40; clerks of the enrolment, £10 each; usher, £30; the six clerks, £40 each; cursitors, £10 each; clerk of the petty bag, £5; examiners, £10 each; chief registrar, £20; under registrars, £10 each; under clerks to the six clerks, £3; clerks of Rolls Chapel, £3 each.|Officers of the Court of Common Pleas|: prothonotaries, £50 each; custos brevium, £80; filacers, £10 each; master of the Fine Office, £30; clerk of the warrants, £10; clerk of the outlawries, £20; clerk of the King\'s Silver Office, £20; clerk of the statutes, £20; clerk of the Habeas Corpora Office, £10; exigenter of the city of London, £40; others exigenters, £5.|Exchequer|:  King\'s Remembrancer, £40; Lord Treasurer\'s Remembrancer, £10; tellers, £20 each; attorneys in the King\'s Remembrancer\'s Office, £10 each; attorneys in Exchequer of Pleas, £10 each; remembrancer of first fruits and tithes, £20; clerk of the pipe, £40; foreign apposer, £20; clerk of estreats, £20; clerk of the pleas, £30; auditor of the Exchequer Receipt, £40; clerk of the pell in Exchequer Receipt, £30; usher of the Court of Exchequer, £20; attorneys in the Office of Pleas in the Court of Exchequer, £10 each; auditors in the Court of Exchequer, £10 each.|Duchy of Lancaster|:  clerk of the court, £10; auditors, £10 each.|Privy Seal Office|:  the clerks, £10 each.|Signet Office|:  the clerks, £10 each.Attorneys-at-law in any of the courts at Westminster, or in the courts of law or equity within any of the counties palatine of Chester, Lancaster or Durham, or the Marches of Wales, £3 each.Officers of the king\'s household receiving a yearly fee of £10, £10 each.Lieutenant of the Tower of London, £50.Individuals who \'can dispend in lands, leases, money, stock or otherwise of his or her owne proper estate £100 per annum\' were to pay 40s., and \'soe proportionably for a greater or lesser estate provided it extend not to persons under £5 yearly\'.  All single persons not chargeable under any of the above, and over the age of 16, were liable for the sum of 12d., while those under the age of 16 had to pay 6d.  Those in receipt of poor relief, however, were exempt.  Widows were to pay one-third of the amount assessed on their husbands.The commissioners were to divide themselves into smaller units and cause the inhabitants of their hundred or division to come before them.  The act was to be read to the inhabitants, who were thereafter to be instructed \'how and in what manner they ought and should make their certificates according to the rates and summes\' payable by them.  The commissioners were then to fix a date for the next appearance of the taxpayers before them, with their completed certificates, under pain of a fine of 40s.  From these certificates, the commissioners were to compile a list of taxpayers to be delivered to the collectors.  Persons whose certificates imposed rates that the commissioners held to be suspect were to be examined on oath, and a new rate would be fixed by the commissioners, if deemed by them to be appropriate.  Anyone refusing to pay this rate would be distrained and his/her goods sold after four days.  There were also penalties for anyone who dissuaded others from paying the rate or colluded in under-assessing it.Anyone living in London or within 15 miles of the city was to pay their tax to the treasurers appointed to receive the tax in London.  Lenders of £100 or more before 1 August 1660, on the security of the act, were to receive repayment with 6% interest from the treasurers.On 12 September 1660 amendments to the bill were made by the commons and an act was passed \'for supplying and explaining certaine defects\' in the first bill.  Householders had to submit to the assessors a list of the names of all occupants and their occupations within two days of a demand being made, or face a penalty fine of £5.  Omissions of names were punishable by fines of 10s. per person omitted.  Commissioners were to return the assessments and names of collectors to the Exchequer by 20 October 1660.  It was made clear that taxpayers were to be assessed on their whole estate, but were to pay in one county or city only.On 29 December 1660 Charles II signed an act making additional amendments to the two acts.  The occupational classes were further clarified, to include those left out: in the Exchequer, attorneys and clerks in the Office of the Clerk of the Pipe and attorneys in Lord Treasurer\'s Remembrancer\'s Office were to pay 20 nobles each.  Barristers-at-law, and anyone who had called himself \'esquire\' in any deed or writing, were to be charged at the rate for esquires.  Further tax commissioners were also added in several counties.  Commissioners were to deliver to the Exchequer by 2 March 1661 interim accounts of all taxes levied, but were not required to make nominal returns.  In these accounts, they were to set out what was rated and assessed, what had been paid, what had been discharged by certificate and what remained to be paid.The tax raised about £227,000, less than was expected, and was slow to be collected; this may be borne out by a letter from the commissioners of the Treasury to the commissioners for poll money in Caernarfonshire, dated 25 March 1665, which appears to relate to this tax.  This complains of underrating, underassessment in numbers of persons, and tax evasion.  The letter also refers to the penalties for such evaders and ordered the commissioners to \'consider what is fit to be redressed, or further reviewed, and act accordingly\'.A series of assessments of individuals for various places in the hundred of Oswestry, Shropshire, are in the National Library of Wales, ref. Brogyntyn Estate Papers TH5/2 (formerly Brogyntyn 7023-4, 7027-9), and for various places in the hundred of Pimhill, Shropshire, ref. Brogyntyn Estate Papers TH5/2 (formerly Brogyntyn 7025-6), with another fragment of the same roll at Brogyntyn MSS I.18).

Further fragments which may once have formed part of this document are also in Pembrokeshire Record office, ref. D/RTP/HAM/144.  However, it is possible that these might also relate to one or other of the poll taxes of 1667 or 1678, as no explicit information as to a possible grant (or other rate) is given in the document.(|Stat.

That ordinance was superceded by this act, which was entitled \'an act for the speedy raising of seventy thousand pounds for the present supply of his Majestye\'.The tax was to be levied by the same commissioners authorised to levy the tax by the ordinance of 26 January, who were to use and execute all powers extended to them thereby.  The period of assessment was to begin on 29 September, and the commissioners in each county were to meet on 5 October, and appoint a receiver-general to whom the tax was to be paid by the local collectors.  The commissioners were also to return signed and sealed duplicate assessments to the Exchequer, together with the names of the receiver-general in each county, by 1 November 1660, the same date on which payment of the tax was due at the Exchequer.(|Stat.

351,1661 Dec 20 ,"eighteen month assessment of £1,260,000 ",Charles II ,"Parliament opened on 8 May 1661, and on 20 December 1661 Charles II signed a bill granting him a total of £1,260,000.  This tax was an 18-month assessment of £70,000 per month, beginning on 25 December 1661 and payable in six quarterly payments of £210,000 each, on prescribed dates.The amounts to be levied in each county and city were specified in the act, and commissioners were appointed, who were instructed to meet by 20 January 1662 and nominate assessors in each parish.  These assessors were to be given directions to assess a poundage rate on lands, fees and offices, as well as on goods, stock and merchandise.  The tax payable was to be apportioned between landlords and tenants, with tenants given the authority to deduct any tax money paid on behalf of the landlord from rents due.Collectors and sub-collectors were to be appointed by the commissioners, to whom duplicates of the assessments were to be delivered and to whom the usual powers of levying distresses to compel payment were extended.  The receiver-general appointed in each county was also to receive duplicates, and a third set of duplicates was to go to the Lord High Treasurer.  Upon receiving payment from the collectors, the receiver-general was to pay the money received into the Exchequer.Surviving assessments of Kent reveal that rates levied in that county were 6d. in the pound on landlords, and 1d. in the pound on tenants (E 179/129/728), and 6d. in the pound \'on all lands, rents, annuities and other yearly profits\', 1d. in the pound \'for store and cropp\', and 1/2d. in the pound on \'all other goods and merchandise\' (E 179/313/20).Although no documents for this tax survive among the records of E 179 for Montgomeryshire, a statement of accounts for this grant relating to the hundred of Llanfyllin exists among the Montgomeryshire deeds and documents of the Clifton family, in the Messrs. Barber and Sons, Solicitors, Mansfield, collection, in Nottinghamshire Archives (ref. DD.B unlisted).  Several assessments of individuals, for this tax for the hundred of Talybolion, Anglesey, are in the National Library of Wales, ref. Carreglwyd Group I 765, with further material at Carreglwyd Group I 913, 944, 965, 967 and 988.The act declared that no more monthly assessments were to be granted, and that this grant was not to be considered as a precedent for others. The revenue from this tax from the counties of Cornwall, Rutland, Monmouthshire, Lancashire, Westmorland and Anglesey was later used to fund the act for the \'distribution of £60,000 amongst the truly loyal and indigent commission officers\' granted later in this same parliament to reward commanders loyal to the Royalist cause during the civil war and commonwealth period (|Stat. Realm|, V, pp 380-88, 737-9; E 179/322/36). (|Stat.

352,1662 May 19 ,hearth tax ,Charles II ,"The bill \'for laying an imposition upon chimney hearths\' was passed in parliament and received royal assent on 19 May 1662. Although a tax referred to in the Domesday book as \'fumage\' provided a pre-conquest precedent for the bill, it is to be doubted whether there was any awareness of such a precedent.  The passage of the act owed more to the current interest in consumption taxes, such as those on ale and beer, and a proposed salt duty, as well as the need to provide a regular source of income for the king.The tax to be levied was a twice-yearly charge of 1s. for every fire, hearth and stove within each \'dwelling, or other house or edifice\', in England and Wales, including lodgings and chambers in the inns of court and chancery, and colleges and other societies.  Houses worth less than 20s. in annual rent, or containing no more than £10 worth of moveable goods, were exempt, as were blowing houses, stamp-furnaces and kilns, and hearths and stoves on the sites of hospitals or almshouses.  The poorest inhabitants of the parish, those exempt from contributing towards poor relief, were also excused from payment.  Anyone claiming exemption by reason of poverty had to procure a certificate attesting to his/her impoverishment, signed by the minister and a churchwarden of their parish, as well as two justices of the peace.  Payment was to be made twice annually - at Michaelmas (29 September) and on Lady Day (25 March) - and the tax was to be collected indefinitely.  Prosecution of arrears, however, was limited to two years.No commissioners were appointed to levy the tax, but rather, the existing local administrative machinery was to be employed.  Constables, headboroughs and other parish officers were responsible for notifying all landlords and tenants that they were to make a written return of the number of their hearths within six days.  Empty houses were to be assessed by the constables, who were also required to enter all inhabited houses in order to verify the returns made by occupants.  The constables were to send in their returns to the next Quarter Sessions following 31 May 1662.  The justices of the peace were then to instruct the clerk of the peace to compile these returns and make two enrolled copies of the assessment of the whole county.  One of these enrolments was for the use of the sheriff, who was charged with receiving the tax, and the other was to be signed by three justices and returned to the Exchequer for use in auditing the sheriff\'s account.Collection of the hearth tax in each parish or township was the responsibility of the petty constable.  He was to collect it within six days of the date on which payment was due, giving acquittances for receipts, and had the usual power of distraint to compel payment.  The petty constable was to deliver the money collected to the high constable of the hundred within 20 days of the payment date, together with lists of taxpayers and defaulters.  Within the next 10 days, the high constable was to make his return to the sheriff, and he, in turn, had a further 20 days in which to account at the Exchequer for the money which he had received.  The entire process was in theory to be completed within nine weeks of the payment date.The tax was slow to be collected, however, and receipts were far below those anticipated, because of various problems in the administration of the tax.  Difficulties in transporting the money, corruption and lack of incentive among the petty constables, abuses in granting exemption certificates, the widespread resistence of taxpayers, and confusion produced by the annual changeover of sheriffs and constables were all factors hampering the efficient assessment and collection of the tax.The revising act of July 1663 addressed some of these problems, but concentrated largely on a perceived negligence in assessment.  New assessments were to be made, and the returns made by the petty constables were to be checked by \'two substantial inhabitants\'.  The assessments were also to be written in books or rolls in two columns under the headings \'Chargeable\' and \'Not Chargeable\'.  A penalty of 40s. was payable by householders making false returns, and the petty constables were liable to be fined £5 if they failed to send their assessment to the high constable within 20 days of receipt from the inhabitants of their parishes.  The high constables were to examine the assessments and forward them to the justices of the peace, two of whom were also to make an examination of them before sending them to the clerk of the peace within 10 days.  The clerk was then to prepare the assessment roll for the county within 20 days, and the duplicate for delivery to the Exchequer within two months.These reforms did little to improve collection, however, as receipts fell further, and by the spring of 1664 it became apparent that the system was in need of re-organisation.  A bill for a second revising act, therefore, was drafted by a commons committee, and became law on 17 May 1664.  Under its terms, the collection of the hearth tax was no longer the duty of the sheriffs, but was instead put into the hands of professional receivers appointed by the lord treasurer, the chancellor and the Exchequer barons.  The receivers gave bonds as security for the collection, appointed their own sub-collectors and took oaths in the Exchequer.  The principle of self-assessment was abandoned.  The receivers were given copies of the 1662 assessment for their area and authority to enter all houses, in the presence of a local constable, in order to review and update the old assessment periodically.Sets of printed instructions for the first collection under their receivership, that due at Michaelmas 1664, were issued to the receivers, one of which is now E 179/265/30.  They gave specific directions for the form and content of the records to be kept by the collectors, and included a |pro forma| account to be used as a sample.  The receivers were to deliver their returns to the clerk of the peace, and as before, he was to prepare county-wide assessments which were to be approved by the justices and returned to the Exchequer.  The procedure for collection was also tightened up; the sub-collectors had the power to levy distresses on refusers after an hour\'s wait, and violent resistance was punishable by imprisonment for one month.  All the money collected was to have been paid in to the Exchequer by the receivers within three months of the payment date.The act of 17 May 1664 also dealt with the recovery of arrears which had accumulated during the sheriffs\' period of administration, assigning this task to the receivers who were to be appointed under a special commission. Berkshire documents demonstrate the means by which this was undertaken at a local level, petty collectors being warranted by their chief constables to produce new assessments, exemptions being signed by the local minister, and all (in principle at least) being signed by one or more justices of the peace (see E 179/243/25). The statutory limit of two years for the prosecution of arrears remained in place, however.  Three types of schedules of arrears were prepared, many examples of which can be found among the E 179 documents.  One listed the names of individuals with three hearths or more owing arrears, another gave the names of petty and high constables who had received money which they had not yet paid in, and a third detailed \'desperate debts\' of which the sheriffs, who were still required to account for their receipts, were to be discharged.  The receiver was to return his arrears schedules to the Exchequer, together with his \'answer\', which indicated what he had and had not collected.Although the efficiency of collection had been improved and the initial receipts under the new administration were encouraging, a stiffening resistance to the tax, lack of cooperation from the justices of the peace, a general economic depression and outbreaks of the plague resulted in a further decline in hearth tax revenue.  By the end of 1665, the receivers\' administration was deemed to be a failure.From Lady Day 1666, the administration of the hearth tax was farmed out under contract to a consortium of London businessmen for a period of seven years, with an option to terminate the contract at the end of three years, and no requirement to account at the Exchequer.  The farmers had to make an advance of £250,000 of the farm towards their annual rent, to help repay two loans of £100,000 each, raised on the strength of anticipated hearth tax revenue in 1665 to finance the war against the Dutch.  The contract also allowed the farmers to claim defalcations (or allowances) for falls in revenue due to plague, invasion, rebellion or fire.  Their administration of the tax proved nonetheless to be little short of disastrous.The great fire of September 1666, in which the new Hearths Office perished, not only seriously diminished the hearth revenue in London, but it also made repayment of the loans to the City companies who had provided them a matter of urgency.  An even greater problem, however, resulted from a bill presented by the commons in Parliament in September 1666 \'for the Sale of Chimney Money\'.  The plan was ultimately rejected on grounds of practicality, but it led to rumours that the hearth tax was to be abolished, and the rising expectations caused by the circulation of these rumours resulted in widespread and violent opposition to the farmers\' collection, when they proved to be unfounded.  Sporadic rioting occurred in various towns over the next two years.  Justices of the peace, moreover, resenting the farmers as socially-inferior outsiders, were often uncooperative or obstructive.  Finally, two other factors which contributed to the farmers\' decision to surrender the farm at the end of three years were the disputes between the farmers and the Treasury over defalcations claimed, and the costly delays and confusion caused by the changeover from the administration of the receivers to that of the farmers at Lady Day 1666.At the surrender of the farm, the entire administration of the hearth tax came to a halt.  The tax was not collected at Michaelmas 1669, while discussions were afoot about how to proceed, but by February 1670 the Treasury had decided to return to the system of appointed receivers, each of whom would manage groups of two or three counties.  This time the system was strengthened by the appointment of two experienced hearth tax administrators as \'Agents\' for the hearth tax, who were to exercise a general supervision over the receivers and collectors and act as a liaison with the Treasury.  In June 1670 standard printed exemption certificates were issued to increase efficiency and perhaps also to limit their proliferation.  Both the administration of the tax and economic conditions generally improved, and receipts began to rise in the 1670s.Nevertheless, this period of receivership ended on Lady Day 1674, when the lord treasurer decided that more revenue could be produced by farming out the hearth tax once again.  Various tenders were considered before the farm was granted to three farmers for a period of five years.  The king had an option to cancel the farm after three years, but he did not exercise this right and, although records are scarce, it seems that this administration was more or less successful.  This five-year period was followed by another five-year lease to different farmers at an increased rent, from Lady Day 1679.  In May 1683, the farm was abolished and nine commissioners were appointed by the king to administer the hearth tax, together with the excise.During the 1680s there was a steady rise in the revenue raised from the hearth money, but the tax was always extremely unpopular and violent outbursts against it continued until its abolition.  Seeking popular support at the onset of his regime, William of Orange promised remission of one of the taxes imposed by his predecessors.  On the recommendation of the commons, he chose this most hated of taxes, widely regarded as a \'badge of slavery upon the whole people exposeing every mans house to be entred into and searched at pleasure by person unknown to him\'.  In the first session of the first parliament of William and Mary, which assembled on 13 February 1689, the Hearth Tax acts were repealed; in Caernarfonshire at least, this news was greeted with approval in a letter dated 4 April 1689:  \'The people are extremely pleased that there is a likelihood to pass the Ludlow bill and the hearth money\' (National Library of Wales, Brogyntyn MSS (Clenennau Letters and papers) 877 (NLW Film 1036)).  Any arrears which were due on 25 March 1689, when collection of the tax officially ended, were still to be collected, however.There are many returns from all stages of the process of assessment and collection of the hearth tax among the E 179 documents and in other series, for example, E 199/9/35 is a schedule of arrears of individuals for the first collection of the hearth tax for Devon.  A few hearth tax assessments are also held in the British Library, county record offices and other local repositories, and a large number of county-wide assessments have been transcribed and published.  Hearth Tax returns for Wales held outside TNA include a roll for Caernarfonshire, which appears to date from the earliest period of the tax, possibly the first collection.  This is in Gwynedd Archives:  Caernarfon Record Office, ref.  QS Hearth Tax, with a transcript at the Archives Department, University of Wales: Bangor, Bangor MS 13491.  One roll for Denbighshire for 1662 and another for 1664 are in the National Library of Wales, ref.

HDX/207/9.Documents in The National Archives in series other than E 179 suggest that there were some difficulties in collecting the tax in several areas of Wales;  an Exchequer inquiry into  sheriffs\' arrears of hearth tax in the counties of Anglesey, Caernarfon, Denbigh, Flint, Merioneth and Montgomery was ordered by commissions dated in 1666 (E 178/6660, containing arrears schedules, 1662-4, and examination of constables, 1665).  Depositions dating from c. 1671 and c. 1673 relating to a further enquiry, into the collection of the tax in Carmarthenshire, Pembrokeshire and Cardiganshire in 1666 and 1667 also survive (E 134/23Chas2/Mich30 and E 179/134/25Chas2/Mich23).  It is clear that another dispute over the sub-farmer\'s collection of the tax during the period 1666-9 in Denbighshire was investigated in the Exchequer, as an original collector\'s book, together with what appear to be copies created for the enquiry, are now at E 179/222/300/1 - E 179/222/300/6.  Other documentation is also at E 134/24Chas2/East29.  Depositions dating from c. 1672 relating the collection of the tax in Carmarthenshire to a period when the tax was farmed also survive (E 134/30Chas2/Mich15 and E 134/31Chas2/East11).Most hearth tax records held in the Public Record Office date from the two periods when they had to be returned to the Exchequer for auditing: Michaelmas 1662 to Lady Day 1666, and Michaelmas 1669 to Lady Day 1674.  C.A.F. Meekings, a former Assistant Keeper, made a thorough study of the PRO\'s hearth tax records, and his notes, organised chronologically by county, have been printed in two volumes:\'Analysis of Hearth Tax Accounts, 1662-1665\' (List &amp; Index Society, CLIII, 1979); and \'Analysis of Hearth Tax Accounts, 1666-1699\' (List &amp; Index Society, CLXIII, 1980).These invaluable volumes give references to the declared accounts of the sheriffs (E 360) for all the instalments of the tax in each county, and refer to other hearth tax documents in the PRO, such as E 165/57, a book of states and views of account of the Receiver of the Hearth Tax for the period 1685-c.1700, and the British Library as well.  Also useful for students of the hearth tax is |The Hearth Tax and Other Later Stuart Tax Lists and the Association Oath Rolls|, ed. J. Gibson, 2nd ed. (Federation of Family History Societies, 1996).  This volume lists all known extant returns by county, as well as all returns in print.TNA series State Papers Domestic contains various scattered documents relating to the hearth tax, for example:  schedule of hearth money for arrears to Lady Day 1665, Durham (SP 46/135/7); fragment of an order containing the date 1667, East Riding of Yorkshire (SP 46/135/13); exemption certificates, Laleston, 1670, and Llangeinor middle hamlet, Newcastle hundred, and Cardiff town, Glamorgan, 1671 (SP 46/135/42, SP 46/135/45 and SP 46/135/43), Anmer, Freebridge Lynn hundred, Norfolk, 1671 (SP 46/135/58), Kenchester, Grimsworth hundred, Herefordshire, 1672 (SP 46/135/61), Long Melford, Suffolk, allowed 1674 (SP 46/135/104) and unidentified, possibly Whilton, Northamptonshire, 1671 (SP 46/135/51).(|Stat.

353,1663 July 27 ,four subsidies ,Charles II ,"The prorogued \'Cavalier Parliament\' which originally began on 8 May 1661, granted on 27 July 1663 four entire subsidies, payable by both the laity and the clergy, in two payments.  The rates were the same as for late Tudor and early Stuart subsidies.  The threshold of liability for those taxed on their moveable goods was £3, on which a rate of 2s.8d. per pound was payable for each subsidy.  For those taxed on land, the threshold was 20s., on which a rate of 4s. per pound, per subsidy, was payable.  Aliens and recusants were required to pay double these rates and if not meeting the minimum threshold for liability, to pay a poll tax of 8d per head for each subsidy.  Titheable lands and servants\' wages were exempt, as was church plate; annuities and corrodies, and plate held by corporations, were taxable.Commissioners to levy the tax in each county were appointed by parliament and their names are recorded in the statute.  The names of the taxpayers, the sums payable and the names of the collectors appointed by the commissioners were to be certified into the Exchequer by 14 October 1663 for the first payment, and by 14 April 1664 for the second payment.  The first payment, of two subsidies, was due on 1 November 1663, and the second payment, of the two remaining subsidies, was to be paid at the Exchequer on 1 May 1664.In addition to those assessments now among the E 179 class of documents, the original assessment for the third and fourth of these subsidies for the hundred of Hinckford in Essex, dated 21 March 1664, is now BL, Add MS 37,078.  A copy of the assessment for all four subsidies in the hundred of Hoxne in Suffolk is preceded by a unique report of the meeting held by the county commissioners, which gives details of the rates which they had agreed among themselves to assess (BL, Add MS 21,047, fo. 3v).  A chronological register of payments made into the Exchequer for these same third and fourth subsidies by the collectors in various counties over the period 12 May 1664 to 20 February 1668 is in BL, Add MS 18,795, fos. 24-38.  It is obvious from the latter document that the tax was slow to be collected.Although no material for this grant for Pembrokeshire survives among the records of TNA series E 179, an order from the commissioners of this tax to the constables of Haverfordwest dated 16 September 1663, to summon persons, probably either assessors or collectors, with regard to levying the subsidies, is in Pembrokeshire Record Office among the Haverfordwest Borough Records, ref. 396.  Although an assessment for the first two subsidies for Maelor hundred, Flintshire, is missing from the National Library of Wales (ref. Bettisfield 695), a letter dated 26 February 1664 from Whitehall to the commissioners for this grant for Flintshire exists (ref. Bettisfield 121) requesting more diligent collection of the subsidies, suggesting that delays had arisen in that county.  An assessment for the hundred of Talybolion, presumably for the second collection of this grant is also in the National Library of Wales (Carreglwyd Group I 808), as is a warrant dated 19 November 1663, presumably to collect the first payment of this grant in the hundred of Dungleddy, Pembrokeshire (Ffynnone 2, 908).The subsidies yielded in net about £221,000, falling \'much short\', as the king complained, of what was intended.(|Stat.

354,1665 Feb 9 ,"royal aid of £2,477,500 ",Charles II ,"The second parliament of 8 May 1661 was still in session, when, on 9 February 1665 it granted a \'royall ayd \'of £2,477,500 payable over three years, or £68,819.9s. per month, to assist the king in meeting the expenses involved in building a navy to defend the seas.  The tax was assessable from 25 December 1664, and was to be paid in twelve quarterly payments of £206,458.6s.8d. each, on prescribed dates, beginning on 1 May 1665.  An adjustment was made in the apportionment of this tax among the counties and cities from previous fixed-yield assessments.  The re-apportionment was carried out by commons committees, and its results, together with the names of the commissioners appointed to levy the tax, are printed in the statute.The commissioners were to meet on 10 March 1665 and appoint assessors, who were to assess a poundage rate on those possessing lands, goods, annuities or offices.  The assessors were to send a copy of their assessments to the commissioners, who were to seal two duplicates of each, delivering one to a sub-collector and the other to the receiver-general, who was to deliver it to the Exchequer.  That duplicate needed to contain only the names of the sub-collectors and the gross sums to be collected by them, not the names of individual taxpayers.An individual assessment for the city of Oxford is edited in Salter, H.E., |Surveys and Tokens A Survey of Oxford in 1772 Sport and Pastime in Stuart Oxford Subsidies in 1543, 1544 and 1648 The Hearth Tax of 1665 The Poll Tax of 1667 A Subsidy of 1667 Oxford Tradesmen\'s Tokens|, 1923, 336-53.Although no documents for Anglesey survive among the records of TNA series E 179, two assessments dated 12 February 1667, presumably for this levy, for places in the hundred of Talybolion, exist in the National Library of Wales, ref.

357,1667 Jan 18 ,act for raising money by a poll ,Charles II ,"For the \'carrying on of the present war\', parliament granted a graduated poll tax on 18 January 1667, following debates, including some opposition, which had lasted since at least November 1666 (National Library of Wales, Wynn of Gwydir 2485, 2487-8).  This was to be levied on both the laity and the clergy for one year.  All individuals had to pay 1s. per head, and parents had to pay for any children under 21 years of age.  Aliens were to pay double this rate.In addition to this flat rate, various other graduated rates were to be levied, according to rank and/or income.  An attempt to tax trade was encompassed in a levy on debts owed and owing, of 20s. per £100, except for loans made to the crown on the security of taxes.  Persons in receipt of a pension, stipend, annuity or other grant from the crown had to pay a tax of 3s. per pound, and office-holders paid 1s. per pound, if they were also liable to pay the monthly assessments, and 3s. per pound, if they were not.  Other ranks, titles and occupations were assessed as follows: |Noblemen|:  dukes, £50; marquesses, £40; earls, £30; viscounts, £25; barons, £20.|Eldest sons of noblemen, aged 21 or older|: dukes, £30; marquesses, £25; earls, £20; viscounts, £17.10s.; barons, £15.|Knights and esquires|:  baronets, £15; knights of the Order of the Bath, £15; knights bachelor, £10; esquires, £5.|Gentlemen|:  over 16 years old, 20s.; minors, possessing an estate of £300 or more, 20s.|Professional men|:  serjeants-at-law, counsellors, attorneys, solicitors, scriveners, advocates, proctors, public notaries, physicians, 2s. of every 20s. of annual income received from the practise of their respective professions (apart from one-third of that income allowed for expenses and deemed to be non-taxable)|Servants|:  1s. of every 20s. of annual wages|Clergy|:  archbishops, £50; bishops, £20; deans, £10; archdeacons, £2; canons and prebendaries worth less than £30 annually, £2.10s.; doctors of divinity, law and physic, £5.No doctors of divinity without benefices were to be charged for their titles.  Widows of laymen or clergymen were to pay one-third of the charge for their husbands\' titles.  Anyone in receipt of alms from the parish, and who did not contribute to poor relief, together with their children under the age of 16, were exempt from payment of the poll tax.The same commissioners as those appointed to levy the aid of £2,477,500, granted on 9 February 1665, were also to levy this tax; additional commissioners were appointed in the statute.  The commissioners were to meet by 14 February 1667, and much the same procedure was to be employed for levying this tax as had been used to assess the income tax granted on 29 August 1660, although sub-collectors were to be chosen by the parish or town in which they were to make their collection, rather than by the commissioners, and the collection in each county, like those of fixed-yield assessments, was to be overseen and received by a receiver-general.  Tax evaders were to be double charged and stringent penalties were put in place for negligent assessors, collectors and receivers.The assessment was to be complete by 1 March, and payment was due on 8 April 1667. Instructions to the collectors for Aldgate ward in London were issued on 29 March 1667 (E 179/314/55).

The money was to be raised by a monthly assessment, the sum required from each county and city per month being laid down in the statute.The commissioners to levy this tax were to be the same ones appointed to levy the poll tax granted on 18 January 1667 and the aid of £2,477,500 granted on 9 February 1665.  They were to follow the same rules and directions, and to have the same powers conferred by the acts granting those taxes.  Payment was to be in four quarterly instalments, over an eleven-month period from 26 January 1668, and the tax, often referred to in the records of its administration as the \'eleven-month assessment\', was administered together with the one-month assessment granted to the Duke of York on 31 October 1665.

359,1671 March 6 ,subsidy for the king\'s extraordinary occasions ,Charles II ,"On 6 March 1671, with the \'Cavalier Parliament\' still in session, parliament granted a subsidy to the king for his \'extraordinary Occasions\', namely, \'a great and present Expence for the necessary Defence of [his] Realmes\'.  This subsidy was a tax to be assessed on income, wealth and debts, payable by all spiritual and temporal persons, regardless of estate or degree.The highest rates were to be levied on \'bankers\', defined as \'persons being Goldsmiths and others\' who have realised extraordinary profit from \'takeing or borrowing great summes of money, and lending out the same againe\'.  They were to pay a tax of 15s. for every £100 of debts owed to them or others in trust for them, both within the realm and outside of it, and were also taxable for debts owed to them by the king, although only the first 5s. (or 1/3 of the amount assessed) was immediately payable; the rest could be paid when the debts were settled.  Anyone who lent money to the king in advance of this levy was to receive repayment with interest of 7%.  Universities, colleges and hospitals were exempt from the tax. The threshold of liability on personal estates was £100, on which 6s. per £100 worth of moveable goods was payable.  Holders of public office were to pay 2s. per pound of fees, profits or perquisites received by them, although one-third of their annual income was allowed for their expenses and deemed non-taxable.  Landowners were obliged to pay a rate of 1s. in the pound on the clear value of their lands, whether freeholds or copyholds, and including mines.  A feature incorporated from the fixed-yield assessments was that tenants were allowed to deduct the tax payable from future rent payments.  Parents or guardians were liable for payments due from minors.Commissioners were to be appointed not by parliament, but by the king under the Great Seal; the commission for the city of Coventry was dated 19 April (E 179/306/3).  They were to hold local meetings by 10 May 1671 and divide themselves into smaller groups, and then to command the appearance before them of local officers, such as constables and bailiffs, within 10 days, under pain of 40s.  They were to read to them the rates specified in the act, instruct them in how to make their certificates, and appoint from among them two assessors in each parish or township.  The assessors were to take an oath to assess impartially and to appear before them again on a prefixed date, with their completed certificates and the names of two persons to be appointed sub-collectors, normally by 27 May 1671.  Defaulting assessors were punishable with a fine of up to £10.  Claims of false assessment were to be appealed before the commissioners.The assessors were to give one copy of the assessment to the commissioners, who were to sign and seal duplicates, one of which was to be delivered to the sub-collectors, another to the head (or high) collectors, and a third to the receiver-general.  In addition to these, an estreat of the sums charged in each locality was to be returned to the Exchequer for certification by 23 June 1671.An attempt was made to exert a tight control over the collection process.  Payment was to be in four quarterly instalments, on 24 June and 29 September 1671, and on 1 January and 25 March 1672.  The sub-collectors, chosen by the residents of the parishes or towns, were to make their demands for payment within six days of receipt of their warrants from the commissioners and to collect the money for the first payment by 12 June.  The head collectors were required \'to call upon them and hasten\' them to make the collection, and if by 19 June it had not been made, they were to levy distresses upon the sub-collectors, so that the head collector, who was in turn to be called upon and hastened by the receiver-general, could deliver the receipts to the latter by 23 June.  Like timescales were put in place for each of the four payments.  Collectors had the usual powers of distraint and of breaking and entering chests, trunks etc. to compel payment of the tax.  Those who escaped payment fraudulently would be double-charged.Under-assessment was again a problem, and the ambitious levy yielded less than £353,000, far below an expected £800,000.(|Stat.

Payment was to be in six equal quarterly instalments, and records of its collection often refer to it as the \'eighteen-month assessment\'.  The sums payable and the names of the commissioners appointed to levy the tax in each county and city are printed in the statute.The period of assessment commenced on 4 February 1673, and payments were due on 3 June, 3 September and 3 December 1673, and 3 March, 3 June and 3 September 1674.    The commissioners were to appoint assessors who would levy a poundage rate on lands, goods and offices.  The assessors were to deliver their assessments to the commissioners, who were to sign and seal two duplicates, one of which was to be delivered to the sub-collectors nominated by them.  In addition, a schedule of sums due from each locality was to be sent by the commissioners to the receiver-general for transmittal to the Exchequer.  In an effort to improve further the machinery of collection, the powers of the receiver-general were strengthened by the abolition of head collectors and their replacement by deputies of the receiver-general, and by other measures.Universities, colleges and hospitals were exempt, but officeholders in Westminster were to be valued and charged.Although no documents for Anglesey survive among the records of TNA series E 179, a warrant to levy the subsidy in the commote of Menai dated 16 June 1673 and a certificate correcting an assessment for this levy, dated 31 July 1673, are in the National Library of Wales, ref.

The act stated expressly that the revenue derived from this levy was to be used only for this purpose.  The provisions of the tax were similar to those of the poll tax granted in 1667, and the tax was to be levied by the same commissioners appointed to assess and levy the tax granted on 16 April 1677 to build thirty warships.Everyone was liable to pay a flat rate of 1s., except paupers and their children, and the children of those persons with four children and an estate of less than £50 in total.  In addition, a charge of 20s. was made for every £100 of cash or debts.  Holders of public office, except those in the armed forces, were to pay 2s. of every pound they received in wages, and government pensioners paid 3s. in the pound on their yearly stipends or pensions.  Members of the legal profession were required to pay 2s. in the pound, and servants 1s. in the pound of their annual income, except for \'board wages\'.

Likewise, the rules of the previous grant were to apply to all other persons involved in the assessing and levying of the tax.The commissioners were instructed to meet together on 4 September that year and put the act into execution.  Payment was to be made in two equal quarterly portions, due to be paid to county receivers by 24 November 1678 and 24 February 1679, respectively. In order to raise money speedily, it was enacted that loans (of up to £150,000) would be accepted upon the security of the act.  Persons making such loans would receive 8% interest every three months until the principal was repaid.  Detailed rules are set out for the administration of these and other sums raised by the grant, and these accord with those of the administration of the previous fixed-yield assessment.Although no material for this tax for Denbighshire survives among the records of TNA series E 179, assessments and other papers for Chirk hundred are in the National Library of Wales, ref.

The grant comprised two separate taxes, the first of which, the grant of supply for disbanding the army, is described above.The second of these taxes was a grant to the king of £412,925.14s.6d.  The reasons for this grant were stated in the act to be as follows: to meet the expenses incurred in equipping the navy; to provide a marriage portion for the king\'s niece, Mary, who had married William of Orange; and to repay £200,000 raised upon the customs (see the \'act for an additional excise upon beer\', 29 Charles II, c 2, s 4).  As with the grant for building thirty warships and the supply to disband the navy, the money was to be raised by monthly assessments of £34,410 9s. 6 1/2d., levied on this occasion over a period of twelve months, beginning on 24 February 1679.  The proportion of the monthly sum due from each county and city is specified in the act.A poundage rate was levied on all real and personal estates, and this money was to be assessed, collected, and paid to the receiver-generals in four equal instalments, on 24 May 1679, 24 August 1679, 24 November 1679, and 24 February 1680, respectively.Colleges and hospitals and their personnel were exempt.

This was a supplement to a grant of a similar kind made the previous year.The money was to be raised by monthly assessments over a period of six months, commencing 24 February 1680.  A total amount of £34,410.9s.6.5d. was to be levied in all counties each month, payable in two equal quarterly instalments of £103,231 8s.7.5d., on 24 May and 24 August 1680.  The sums due from each county and city, and the names of the commissioners appointed to levy the tax were specified in the statute.The commissioners were to have the same powers to assess, levy and collect this tax as were given to the commissioners appointed to levy the act to raise £584 2s 2 1/2d to build thirty ships passed on 8 April 1677, and an identical administrative structure for assessment and collection was created under this act.  The act also contains detailed provisions for the disbursement of the tax money to the disbanding forces by commissioners appointed for this purpose.Anyone lending money in advance of the levy was to receive a tally and order for repayment, together with 8% interest.  If funds were still insufficient to pay the wages of the commissioned officers, the treasury commissioners were empowered to give treasury debentures for payment, with interest of 8%, paid quarterly.An order to collect the tax in Haverfordwest, dated 19 Jan 1679/80, is in Pembrokeshire Record Office, ref.

It granted to the king £70,000 per month for disbanding the whole army and paying off that part of the navy which had returned to harbour by 8 September 1660.  The tax was to be in effect for two months, beginning on 1 November 1660, and was to be levied in the same way and by the same commissioners as the assessment of £70,000 for the king\'s present supply, granted on the same day.The commissioners were to meet on 6 November, and the whole £140,000 was to be paid by 25 December 1660, when duplicate assessments were also due at the Exchequer, together with the names of the receiver-general appointed to receive the money in each county.  The receivers-general were to pay their receipts to the treasurers at the Guildhall in London, who were to disburse it, and account before parliament.

448,1660 Dec 29 ,"act for granting £420,000 to the king ",Charles II ,"On 29 December 1660, the last day of the parliament which began on 25 April, the king signed an act granting him a total of £420,000, or £70,000 per month for six months, to take effect on 1 January 1661.The tax was to be levied in England and Wales \'according to such rates, rules and proportions and by the same commissioners\' as the assessment of £70,000 for disbanding the army and navy passed on 13 September 1660, although additional commissioners were appointed by and named in this statute also.  The commissioners were to meet on 12 January 1661 to execute the act, and to appoint receivers-general by 1 February 1661 to receive the tax.  Half of the total sum (£210,000) was to be paid to the receivers-general by 1 February 1661, and the other half by 1 April 1661.  These receivers were to deliver their receipts to treasurers who were appointed to receive and disburse the money at the Guildhall, London, and to account for it before parliament.  Anyone who lent money, by way of advance, by 31 December 1660, or who lent £100 or more by 10 January 1661, would receive repayment from the treasurers, together with interest of 10%.Receipts given by the Surrey high collector Henry Byne reveal that payment was received there slowly.

650,1662 May 19 ,militia money ,Charles II ,"On 19 May 1662, in Charles II\'s second parliament, royal assent was given to an act \'for ordering the forces in the several counties of this kingdom\'.  This act specified the charges that could be made towards the maintenance of county militias, and its provisions were similar to other such acts passed under the Commonwealth.The lord lieutenants and their deputies had authority over the militia, which included the power to appoint officers and to muster, arm and train troops.  They were empowered to charge the wealthier inhabitants with the provision and maintenance of various soldiers.  No one was to be charged with providing a horse, horseman and arms unless in possession of a landed estate worth at least £500 per annum or a personal estate of £6,000, and no one could be asked to provide a foot soldier and arms who did not enjoy an income from land of £50 per annum or a personal estate of £600.  Lord or deputy lieutenants could, however, join together two or more persons, whose combined estates were equal to these values, and charge them accordingly.The lieutenants were also given the power to \'lay fitting rates\' for furnishing ammunition and \'other necessaries\', not exceeding in a year the proportion of a fourth part of a one-month\'s assessment of £70,000.  These rates were to be levied in the same way as described in the \'act for £70,000 by the month\', and in case of \'invasions, insurrections or rebellions\'.Other powers of enforcement were conferred upon the lieutenants, who were also to appoint treasurers to receive all such militia rates levied and account before them every six months.  Copies of these accounts were to be furnished to the justices of the peace.The act also provided that \'in case of apparent danger to the present government\' it would be lawful for the king at any time within the next three years, beginning 25 June 1662, to raise such sums of money as shall be necessary \'for the defraying of the whole or such part of the militia...as [he] shall be obliged to imploy in order to the quiet and security of this nation\', not exceeding the sum of £70,000 per year.  This money was to be raised by the lieutenants according to the rules and directions laid down for the levy of the \'eighteen months assessment\' (granted on 20 December 1661).The latter provision amounted in effect to a tax of £70,000 for three years, and is known to have been levied, although it was not accounted for at the Exchequer, but raised and expended in the localities for the support of the militia.(|Stat.

925,1663 June 20 or later - July 23 ,four clerical subsidies ,Charles II ,"Although Charles II apparently wished to restore a limited form of episcopacy to the English church, he encountered some opposition to his plans and it took some time before bishops and convocation were restored to their former position.  Convocation was summoned to meet on 8 May 1661, but for the time being the clergy continued to be taxed with the laity.  Diocesan administration had to be reconstructed after a twenty-year hiatus and there were more pressing matters to attend to, such as the revision of the Book of Common Prayer.  Opposition to the re-establishment of convocation surfaced in 1661, moreover, and it was not until the session that began on 20 June 1663 that the clergy of Canterbury convocation granted the king four subsidies of 4s. in the pound, over three and a half years.  The grant of the subsidies was confirmed by parliament on 8 July 1663, in the session that sat from 18 February to 27 July 1663, and on 23 July 1663, the clergy of the province of York gave their assent to the grant.The terms of the levy were virtually identical to those of the last subsidies granted to Charles I.  The first subsidy was to be paid in one instalment, but the other three were levied in two annual payments of 2s. in the pound each.  As before, the subsidy was to be levied on income from all manner of benefices and clerical offices, and paid by every archbishop, bishop, dean, archdeacon, prebendary, provost, master of college, master of hospital, parson, vicar and all other members of the clergy enjoying any spiritual promotion or other temporal possessions annexed to the same spiritual promotions.  Parsons, vicars and other clergy whose benefices were valued at less than £6 13s. 4d. per annum were wholly exempt.  Vicars whose benefices were valued at less than £8 per annum were also wholly exempt, and vicars whose benefices were valued at between £8 and £10 per annum were to pay only 13s. 4d. for each whole subsidy, and 6s. 8d. for each half subsidy.  Only benefices worth more than £10 per annum, therefore, were to pay the full rates.The subsidy was to be levied according to the valuation made for first fruits and tenths, with deduction made for payment of the tenth part of their income, under the act of first fruits and tenths.  The clergy were to be taxed for the subsidy, therefore, on nine-tenths of their income.  No one promoted to a benefice or office, who had compounded or was to compound for payment of first fruits between 1 December 1630 and 1 June 1635 was liable to pay any of the subsidies in the first year after his composition.  Allowable deductions from the taxable value of new bishoprics, deaneries, cathedral or collegiate churches, or colleges, etc. were whatever portions of their revenue had been given for the maintenance of poor men, school masters, ushers, grammarians, choristers, petty canons, vicars choral, readers of divinity, singing men, vergers and other necessary and daily officers or ministers, and the expenses of rebuilding or repairing of any cathedral or collegiate churches or colleges.  These deductions were to be certified to the Exchequer, upon due search and examination by the bishop or archbishop (or by the dean and chapter, in the event of a vacant see), by the respective dates of payment of the subsidies.  Any parson, vicar or other clergyman paying a pension (i.e., to stipendiary priests) which was not deducted from the assessment for his liability for these subsidies was allowed to retain for his own use the amount of it for which he was taxed.  Stipendiary priests themselves were not liable to pay the subsidies.Exempt from payment of the subsidies were any benefices, almshouses, hospitals or grammar schools belonging to any college within the universities of Oxford or Cambridge, the college of Westminster, to Eton College or Winchester College.  No cathedrals, churches or other ecclesiastical places which had previously been charged with maintaining anniversaries, obits, lights, lamps etc. in chantries, which were now in the king\'s hands, were to pay any tax on any part or portion of income from such chantries to which the king was now entitled or possessed of, but were to have deduction and allowance made to them in their assessment for the subsidies accordingly.  The same was to be true of concealed lands, which had previously been in the hands of cathedrals or churches, but were no longer in their possession. Lay farmers or other lessees of forms of spiritual income were likewise liable to pay the subsidies on behalf of their landlords, unless they could produce any writings, covenants or bonds that showed otherwise.  Spiritual possessions were not subject to payment of fifteenths or other taxes granted by the laity, however.The subsidy was to be collected by the bishops and their appointees in every diocese, or by the dean and chapter in the case of a vacant see, and they were to certify the names of all deputy collectors appointed.  The first subsidy was to be collected on 5 October 1663, and the other three subsidies were to be collected twice yearly on 26 March and 5 October, beginning on 26 March 1664 and ending on 5 October 1666.  The revenue collected each year on 5 October was to be paid into the Exchequer by the following 22 February, and that collected each year on 26 March was to be paid into the Exchequer by the following 14 July.  Each collector was to receive an acquittance upon payment of the tax money, for which he was to be charged only 4d.Collectors were empowered to compel payment of the subsidies from any defaulters by sequestration of the fruits and profits of their benefices or offices, after lawful warning given to them, to release them from any ecclesiastical censures under which they had been placed, once their payment had been received, and to revoke all process made against them.  Collectors or bishops could sell goods distrained from defaulters, remitting the money received for them to the Exchequer.  After a first refusal to pay, the defaulter was liable for the collector\'s costs in coming, going and demanding the tax, and after a second refusal, he was bound to pay the fourth part of the subsidies in addition to the amount that he had been assessed to pay.  In the event of obstinate and persistent refusal to pay, the defaulter would forfeit one year\'s profits of his benefice or office, 50 days after due warning. Collectors were to be discharged of any amounts that they certified to the Exchequer by 22 February (for payments due on 5 October) and by 14 July (for payments due on 26 March) each year that they were unable to collect from defaulters, and the form and exact wording of this certificate was specified in the subsidy act.Within four days of the collector\'s arrival at the Exchequer with the tax money, the appointed receiver was to receive the money and deliver a receipt to the collector or his deputy for every payment made.  Auditors of collectors\' accounts were to hear and audit their accounts within six days after a request to account had been made, and were to give bonds to this effect.  For every default or delay in the accounting procedure, the auditor was to be fined £10, half of which was to be paid to the collector so inconvenienced and half to the crown, upon complaint made to the treasurer, under-treasurer or chief baron of the Exchequer.  The offending auditor was to be imprisoned until paying the forfeited sum.  All acquittances given by collectors to taxpayers were to be honoured at the Exchequer, and if they were not, then the offender was to be subject to the same penalties as above specified.  Collectors were to be allowed 6d. of every pound for the charges of collection, carrying and paying in of the subsidies, and were to receive an acquittance at their final accounting each year, for which acquittance the accountant would be charged the sum of 3s.4d. to be paid to the clerk for writing it.This subsidy proved to be the last clerical subsidy.  In November 1664 a verbal agreement made between the archbishop of Canterbury and the lord treasurer, Edward Hyde, earl of Clarendon, established that the clergy would henceforth be taxed with the laity.  When they were included in the \'aid\' granted to Charles II by parliament in February 1665, and in consideration of their abandonment of the right of self-taxation, the clergy were remitted payment of the last two of the four subsidies (16 &amp; 17 Charles II, c. 1, s. 30).  In return for surrendering this right, the English clergy also received the vote in parliamentary elections.(Wilkins, |Concilia|, IV, p 578; |Stat Realm|, V, pp 481-488 (15 Charles II, c. 10); P.

A Committee for the Militia of Westminster was appointed under the act, which was authorised to raise forces as necessary and to commission officers to command them.  To pay for this militia a total monthly charge of up to £1,000 was to be levied upon everyone owning real or personal property within the parishes of Westminster and its liberties.  The ordinance and monthly charge were to remain in force for one year from 14 March 1649.(|Acts and Ordinances|, II, pp 20-23; |CJ|, VI, p 168) ",Origin  Granted,1st: 1649 March 14
341,1649 April 7 ,assessment for the forces in England and Ireland ,Commonwealth ,"On 7 April 1649 parliament passed an act to raise £90,000 monthly for the maintenance of the armies in England and Ireland.  This assessment replaced the ordinances of 17 March and 6 October 1648 for the previous monthly assessments of £60,000 and £20,000 for those armies, and was to be levied for six months, commencing retrospectively, from 25 March to 29 September 1649. All the commissioners appointed to levy the tax, and the sums apportioned to the various counties, were set out in the ordinance.  As in the previous assessments, the tax was to be assessed and levied according to a poundage rate and \'according to the same way and rules as in the late Assessments hitherto have been held\'.  In November 1650 a minimum threshold of liability for the assessment of £20 in moveable goods or 20s. annual income from land was introduced.  Those who paid towards the assessment were not to be obliged to billet or quarter soldiers.Repeated acts extended this monthly assessment until December 1654, although the total sums demanded over that time varied.  The acts and overall monthly sums assessed were as follows:7 April 1649:               £90,000   25 March 1649        - 24 June 1649 (1st period)25 June 1649          - 29 September 1649 (2nd period)1 August 1649:           £90,000   29 September 1649 - 29 December 16497 December 1649:      £90,000   29 December 1649  - 25 March 1650£60,000   25 March 1650        - 24 June 165021 May 1650:             £90,000   24 June 1650           - 29 September 1650£60,000  29 September 1650 - 25 December 165026 November 1650:  £120,000  25 December 1650 - 25 April 165115 April 1651:           £120,000  25 March 1651        - 29 September 16511 September 1651:    £120,000  29 September 1651 - 25 December 165119 December 1651:    £90,000   25 December 1651 - 24 June 165215 June 1652:             £90,000   24 June 1652          - 25 December 165210 December 1652:  £120,000  25 December 1652  - 25 June 165327 July 1653:            £120,000  25 June 1653           - 25 December 165324 November 1653:  £120,000  25 December 1653 - 24 June 16548 June 1654:             £120,000  24 June 1654          - 29 September 1654£90,000  29 September 1654 - 25 December 1654Sometimes the payments were to be made monthly, at other times, at intervals of two or three months.  In the first six months, for example, there were to be four payments: the first three months\' assessment was to be paid by 9 June 1649; thereafter collections were to be made monthly, on the first day of each month (E 179/128/681; E 179/249/20).Documents generated by local collectors in Kent often refer to these assessments not by the overall sum required but by the poundage rates charged (see, for example, E 179/128/679, 680, 681; E 179/249/20).A bundle of assessments of individuals for this tax, for places in Stanborough and Coleridge hundreds, Devon, dated in January 1653, for the six months from 25 December 1652, are at C 103/17.  Another bundle in the same piece contains one assessment of individuals for the same period, for Revelstoke parish, Plympton hundred, Devon, and another for Chivelstone parish, Coleridge hundred, Devon.

343,1655 Feb 8 ,assessment to maintain the army and navy ,Commonwealth ,"On 8 February 1655 Protector Cromwell and his council issued an order for an assessment of £60,000 per month for the maintenance of the army and navy, continuing the monthly assessments by ordinances made in June 1647, March and October 1648 and April 1649.  This tax was to be supplemented by £80,000 of revenue from customs duties for a total monthly yield of £140,000.  The assessment was to begin on 25 December 1654 and was initially to be for a six-month period, payable in two instalments (on 20 March and 20 May 1655), but it was later extended indefinitely.  The £60,000 per month was, as before, apportioned among the counties and cities in proportions specified in the act.  Although passed under the Commonwealth and after the expiry of the last ordinance extending the ordinance of 7 April 1649, this assessment was in effect another continuation of that tax, as indicated in the account book of the receiver-general of Surrey, Benjamin Goodwin, for the years 1649-1662 (E 179/270/9).The assessment was extended for a further six months at the same monthly rate of £60,000 by a declaration of 24 June 1655, according to a document related to the levy of the tax in Kent (E 179/128/681).  The same document also refers to a subsequent extension enacted by proclamation on 27 November 1655, for a further six months at the same rate.  Printed receipts indicate that this tax was payable in two instalments - on 31 January and 14 March 1656 (E 179/128/685).Although evidence of further extensions does not appear in published sources, it is clear that the tax continued to be levied throughout 1656 and 1657.  The next extension of the assessment, covering the period 24 June to 25 December 1656, was payable on 20 July and 10 October 1656, and the one following, which ran for three months, from 25 December 1656 to 25 March 1657, was to be paid in two instalments - on 10 November 1656 and 10 February 1657 (E 179/128/685).  The next published reference to the assessment was on 9 June 1657, when a retrospective assessment at the same rate was ordered, to commence from 25 March, and to last for three months.  The Kent high collector\'s accounts state, however, that this extension was ordained by an act of the parliament which took effect on 27 September 1656, although he does not cite the date of the ordinance (E 179/249/20).On 26 June 1657 the monthly sums levied by the assessment were adjusted by a parliamentary ordinance: see assessment for the armies and navies of the Commonwealth of 26 June 1657 (England was to contribute £35,000, Scotland £6,000 and Ireland £9,000.  The sums were to be paid quarterly, on 1 September, 1 December, 1 March and 1 June each year, for three years.  The apportionment of these sums among the counties and the commissioners appointed to levy them were mandated in the act.  It is clear from an account rendered for Kent that, although collected at three-month (quarterly) intervals, the first year\'s assessments were thought of as six-month units (see E 179/128/682 and E 179/249/20), and an assessment for Nottinghamshire was said to have been for the second six months from 25 December 1657 to 24 June 1658 (E 179/160/318).  The next payments, however, were treated as three-month units; the second year\'s payments in Kent were accounted for quarterly (E 179/249/20)).On 18 June 1659 another act amended the collection procedure for the final year from 24 June 1659.  This time the tax was to be paid in two equal instalments, on 1 August and 10 October 1659.On 1 June 1660, a further act extended the assessment for a final three month period, from 24 June - 29 September 1660, at a rate of £70,000 per month; see also the entry for 26 January 1660.Summary of acts and amounts of monthly assessments:8 February 1655:       £60,000 25 December - 24 June 165530 May 1655:            £60,000 24 June - 25 December 165527 November 1655:  £60,000 25 December 1655 - 24 June 165629 May 1656:            £60,000 24 June 1656 - 25 December 165624 June 1656:           £60,000 25 December 1656 - 24 March 16579 June 1657:             £60,000 25 March 1657 - 24 June 165726 June 1657:           £35,000 24 June 1657 - 24 June 1660 (in six-monthly units)1 June 1660:             £70,000 24 June 1660 - 29 September 1660 (|Acts and Ordinances|, II, pp 1029-1035, 1234-1249, 1284-1286; |CJ|, VII, pp 545, 553) |Stat.

(The document at E 179/220/160 suggests that the assessments for the six-month period beginning 24 June 1656 and also a six month period beginning 25 December 1656 were made by order of the Protector and Council, although the latter may only have run for three months, as it appears to have been partly superceded by the subsequent assessment for the three-month assessment commencing on 25 March 1657, made under a separate Act of Parliament.)

344,1657 June 9 ,assessment for the war with Spain ,Commonwealth ,"On 9 June 1657 Protector Cromwell and parliament ordained a new monthly assessment of £60,000 to be levied throughout England to support the costs of war with Spain.  The assessment took effect retrospectively, from 25 March 1657, and was to last for three months.  The apportionment of sums to the individual counties, and the nomination of commissioners to oversee the levy in each county, is recorded in the act.The first meeting of the commissioners, at which they were to divide themselves and appoint surveyors and assessors, was to take place by 25 June.  The surveyors and assessors were to ascertain and rate the yearly value and profits of the parishes, townships and places within their bounds, and report back to the commissioners at the second meeting of the latter, which was to take place by 9 July.  At this second meeting, the commissioners were to decide on the rates to be apportioned among the parishes and towns, and appoint two or more assessors in each parish and town.A poundage rate on lands and goods was to be assessed by these assessors.  The same rate was to be levied on every 20s. worth of land as was charged for every £20 worth of moveable goods.  Duplicate assessments were to be made, one of which was to be given to the collectors.  They were to collect the money, with powers to levy distresses and sell goods, and break into chests etc., to procure payment, if necessary.  Persistent refusal to pay, was, as usual, punishable by imprisonment and sequestration.Payment was to be apportioned between landlords and tenants, under the same rules as for previous assessments, and provision was made for appeal to the commissioners in cases of over-assessment.  A new feature, however, was the provision for re-assessment of individuals where the overall sum levied in the parish or town fell short of that set by the commissioners.  Indeed, no parish or town was to be discharged from their obligation to pay the assessment until the whole amount had been received at the Exchequer.University stipends and the hospitals in London and Southwark were not to be charged, however. Payment of the whole sum was due on 24 July 1657.(|Acts and Ordinances|, II, pp 1058-1097) ", ,1st: 1657 July 24
345,1660 Jan 26 ,assessment to defend the Commonwealth ,Commonwealth ,"On 26 January 1660 the reconvened parliament determined that, in view of the debts incurred during the Protectorate because of the Spanish war, and the danger to the Commonwealth from royalists seeking to restore the monarchy, a further sum of £100,000 per month for six months was required to maintain the forces for defence.  England was to contribute £70,000, Scotland £12,000 and Ireland £18,000 each month (precisely double the rates set for the assessment for the supply of the armies and navies of the Commonwealth of June 1657).  The assessment period was to begin retrospectively, on 25 December 1659, which is confirmed by the printed receipts for the first six months of this assessment levied in Sussex (E 179/191/408). The first three months\' assessment was to be paid in one sum by 10 March and the second payment was due on 10 May 1660.  The assessors were required to assess \'by a pound rate as formerly\'.  The apportionment of the tax among the counties of all three countries, and the names of the commissioners appointed by the act are all printed in the act.The first parliament of Charles II, which opened on 25 April 1660, passed an act for \'putting in execution an ordinance\' passed in the king\'s absence, for a monthly assessment of £70,000 for the army and navy for the defence of the realm.  This assessment, to run for three months, was, in effect, a continuation of this act (see also the assessment for the armies and navies of the Commonwealth of June 1657).  Chandaman gives a date of 1 June 1660 for the royal assent for this tax, but E 179/312/53, a bundle of receipts for Hampshire, gives the date of the Ordinance as Friday 8 June 1660, as do other surviving receipts for this tax (e.g. E 179/304/8, E 179/323/6).(|Acts and Ordinances|, II, pp 1355-1403; |Stat.

346,1660 March 12 ,act for settling the militia of England and Wales ,Commonwealth ,"On 12 March 1660 parliament repealed the act of 26 July 1659 for settling the militia of England and Wales, and replaced it with a new act for raising and paying for the militia in each county.  New commissioners were appointed under the act in each county, who, as under the previous act, were to assess and charge the inhabitants of their county towards making contributions of horses, arms and ammunition, although the thresholds of liability for assessment were higher.No one was to be charged with providing horse and arms who possessed an estate of less than £500 per annum in lands or £6,000 in goods or money, nor with providing a foot soldier, without an income of at least £40 per annum in lands or £500 in goods or money.  It was allowed to the commissioners to join together two or three persons and charge them jointly to find horse and arms, provided that no one person was charged for a foot soldier who did not possess at least £15 a year in lands or £200 in goods, nor for \'horse\' with less than £100 a year in lands.  As before, tenants asked to pay could pass on the costs to their landlords, deducting the money out of future rent, and although persons were to be assessed on their entire estate, they were to pay in one county only.  Complaints about assessment were to be heard and remedied by the commissioners.There was also to be a charge levied for \'furnishing drums, colours, trophies, ammunition, and other emergencies\' in the counties, in the same proportion as a one-month\'s national assessment of £35,000 in the county would be, at the maximum.  This charge was to be \'assessed, collected, and paid according to such direction as shall be given from time to time by the Parliament or Council of State\' to the treasurers appointed by the commissioners.  The horses and arms were to be returned to their owners at the end of their period of service.The commissioners were also to disburse wages to the soldiers of 2s. per day for \'horse\' and 1s. for \'foot\'.  In the case of emergencies, the persons charged with maintaining a soldier were to provide him with a month\'s wages in advance.  The commissioners had the power to impress wagons, at 6d. per mile outward, and imprison and fine mutineers, those refusing to find soldiers or embezzlers of arms, or soldiers who did not appear when summoned.Treasurers had to account to parliament or the Council of State every six months for receipts and disbursements.(|Acts and Ordinances|, II, pp 1425-1455) ",Origin  Granted,1st: 1660 March 12

The act presumably superseded that of 7 July 1659 for settling the militia in London, and its terms were similar to the \'act for settling the militia in England and Wales\', passed on the same day.No one was to be charged with providing \'horse and arms\' who possessed an estate of less than £500 in goods or money, nor with providing a foot soldier, without possessing at least £40 per annum in lands or a personal estate of £500 in goods or money.  The commissioners could join together two or three persons and charge them jointly to find \'horse and arms\', but, unlike the act for the militia of England and Wales, there was no threshold of minimum value of estate in these joint assessments.  Like the act for the militia of England and Wales, there was also to be a special charge levied for \'furnishing drums, colours, trophies, ammunition, and other emergencies\' in the city and liberties, to be levied in equal proportion to two months of a national assessment of £35,000, at the maximum.  All inhabitants were to be assessed in the city or county where their principal estate lay and were to be exempt, upon production of a certificate, from assessment in any other place.  Anyone refusing or neglecting to provide horse and arms as assessed was to be fined £20, which would be levied, together with the value of horse, arms etc. assessed upon him, by distress and sale of goods.  The commissioners were empowered to hear, determine and remedy complaints about assessments.The commissioners were also to disburse wages to the soldiers of 2s. per day for \'horse\' and 1s. for \'foot\'.

441,1655 Sept 21 ,decimation tax ,Commonwealth ,"This tax on royalists was imposed by the Protector.  The government of the Protectorate devised three means of dealing with former royalists, dividing them into three categories.  Royalists of the first category had their estates sequestered, and those of the second were banished from the country but allowed to keep their estates.  It was royalists of the third category - those who, though no longer active royalists, had formerly had their estates sequestered for delinquency, or had in former times fought against the parliamentary army - were liable to pay this tax.  They were to be charged 10% of their rent from land if it amounted to £100 or more, and £10 on every £1,500 of personal property in cases where they did not have real estate worth £100 per annum, with the proviso that their annual payments of this tax should never exceed £100.The instructions to the commissions of major-generals who were charged with assessing and collecting the tax were issued on 21 September 1655.  The tax was to be collected every six months beginning on 21 December 1655.  E 179/272/2 contains an account of the monies collected in two hundreds of Hertfordshire rendered several years later, for the period ending 21 December 1656, the date on which the tax ceased to be collected.

Appointed commissioners in each county were to meet monthly to carry out various duties.  These included the taking of oaths of loyalty by officers of the militia, the investigation of activities and conspiracies by \'disaffected individuals\', and the disarming and securing of anyone engaged in questionable activities.  To finance the provision of these local forces, individuals were charged according to income with providing soldiers of varying ranks, and the assessors could combine the assessments on several persons to finance a more expensive rank - for example, a \'horse\' rather than a foot soldier.  Individuals with less than £10 annual income from lands or tenements, or less than £200 in personal estate, were exempt.A county rate was also to be levied to furnish \'Drums, Colours, Trophies, Ammunition and other Emergencies\', not to exceed the rate levied in the county in one month of a national monthly assessment of £90,000.  The commissioners were, additionally, empowered to furnish transport for the militia and their equipment when required, and to punish mutineers by imprisonment or fines.  They could also fine anyone who refused to contribute or provide soldiers, according to their assessments.  The act was to be in force until 1 February 1651.The act was continued until 1 May 1651 by an act of 28 January 1651, and by a further act of 3 April 1651, it was extended for six months.  The latter act also made clear that it did not apply to the Isle of Wight.  A further extension until 1 December 1651 was granted by an act passed on 12 August 1651, and provision for an additional one-month assessment thereafter was made by an act of 2 September 1651.(|Acts and Ordinances|, II, pp 397-402, 551-552, 555-556; |CJ|, VI, pp 528, 556) ",Origin  Granted,"1st: 1650 July 11, 2nd: 1651 Feb 1, 3rd: 1651 May 1, 4th: 1651 Oct 1, 5th: 1651 Dec 1"

Nevertheless, moneys paid into the parliamentary treasury were received, and receipts issued, in connection with the act, which was intended finally to call in and clear the moneys due and accounts still outstanding as of 3 November 1640.  Three earlier ordinances passed with the same intention, in February 1644, 11 July 1644, and 26 June 1645, were now superseded by this Act, and any papers or other items in the hands of the committees and sub-committees established by those ordinances were to be passed over to the new committee.

Those who had already cleared their accounts with any of the earlier committees were to present their acquittances and discharges to the new committee within the same period(s) of time, so that they could be registered.  Further time could be granted provided the person responsible appeared before the committee to make the request.  Those who failed to comply with any of the above instructions were liable, if found \'faulty in the premises\', to forfeit a fifth of the value of whatever was concealed or outstanding from their own personal estate.  \'Discoverers\' who informed upon guilty parties and were soldiers with pay arrears due to them or were otherwise owed money by the Commonwealth, were to be paid out of these forfeitures.The act also called for the submission of accounts by those \'who under the pretence of authority from the late King, or any acting under him, have.....levyed or received moneys\'.E 179/187/468A and 468B, the collected papers of Richard Wither, Treasurer of the Western Division of Surrey between 30 January 1642 and 25 March 1649, were submitted in compliance with this act, as witnessed by a receipt  for outstanding moneys received (f. 441) referring to the act and dated 17 November 1653.

The commissioners charged persons according to their personal estates only and neglected to assess them for their landed income, nor did they charge anyone for the provision of drums, colours, powder, match and bullet.  In order to provide the latter, therefore, parliament passed an act on 2 August 1659 authorising the commissioners who had been appointed to levy the monthly assessments for the army, beginning on 24 June 1659, to levy an additional assessment for three months within the city and liberties of London.  The assessment of all inhabitants was to be \'according to the monethly rate\' payable under the monthly assessments for the army.  Any tenant charged for the assessment was to be allowed to subtract it from the rent due to his landlord.  The tax was to be paid in one payment within the next 10 days.  The money was to be received at the Guildhall, London by the treasurer appointed by the commissioners, who was then to pay it over to the Committee for the Militia of London.The act also made provision for the payment by those charged with providing horse or arms under the \'act for settling the militia of London\' to those persons serving with their horse and arms of \'maintenance of man and horse\', or to persons bearing \'their foot arms\', of \'such reasonable allowance and wages\' for each day and night of service in the militia.

660,1657 June 26 ,assessment for the armies and navies of the Commonwealth ,Commonwealth ,"26 June 1657 was an extremely busy day for Parliament. Whilst finding room for acts dealing with such equally pressing issues as the better observation of the Lord\'s Day, and the punishment of \'such Persons as live at high rates and have no Estates, Profession, or Calling answerable thereunto\', time was also found for an \'Act for an assessment at the rate of £35,000 by the month upon England, £6,000 by the month upon Scotland, and £9,000 by the month upon Ireland, for three years from 24 June 1657, for a temporary supply towards the maintenance of the Armies and Navies of this Commonwealth\'. An apportionment of the assessment across the country was included in the ordinance. With a few additions the commissioners were those named in the \'Act for an Assessment upon England, at the rate of Threescore thousand pounds by the month for three months\', which had been passed earlier in June, and their duties and powers were to be the same. According to the act collections were to be quarterly, on the first days of September, December, March and June in each of the three twelvemonths; however most Buckinghamshire documents giving estreats of sums collected cover six month periods (e.g. E 179/80/316), an exception being E 179/80/328, which covers a full year.A further assessment, enacted on 26 January 1660, imposed precisely double the \'national\' levies involved here, to be raised monthly for sixth months: presumably this can be seen as both an extension and an intensification of the present tax.(|Acts and Ordinances|, II, pp 1234-1249.

2,1275 Oct 18 x 24 ,fifteenth on the laity and clergy ,Edward I ,"The parliament which granted this fifteenth on moveable goods for the relief of the king, because of crusading debts, began on c. 18 October 1275.  Commissions for assessment and collection were issued on 24 October.  A fifteenth was also granted by the prelates.Items exempt from assessment were \'treasure, riding-horses, bedding, clothes, vessels, tools, geese, capons, hens, bread, wine, beer, cider and all kinds of food provided and ready for use\' of those who were not merchants or burgesses, but the latter were taxed on these items.  The minimum value of property to be taxed was 15s.There were complaints about faulty and mistaken assessments, and on 17 November 1276, sheriffs and royal stewards were ordered to rectify mistakes in the presence of the taxers. The tax money collected was to be paid into safe repositories, such as abbeys, in the counties, and was slow to come in.  Orders concerning the disbursements make it clear that payment was to be made in two halves, but no payment dates are specified within these, nor in the commissions.  The abbot of Gloucester did not pay the first instalment until 27 December 1276, and some amounts from the first payment were still outstanding on 6 February 1278.  Leicestershire, however, paid the second instalment on 16 March 1278.  Some of the money was used to pay the king\'s debts to merchants; the first half of the payment in Oxford and Berkshire, for example, was paid over to merchants on 6 January 1277.  The tax collectors were still in arrears on 23 March 1279, when various individuals were ordered to appear at the Exchequer after Easter to deliver them.(W Stubbs, |Select Charters|, ed. H.W.C.

3,1279 Feb 16 ,scutage ,Edward I ,"On 12 December 1276 the feudal host was summoned to muster against Llewelyn at Worcester on 1 July 1277.  Those tenants in chief unable or unwilling to send their due quotas made fine for their service at rates varying from 10 to 50 marks the fee.The scutage in connection with this campaign was not put in charge until 16 February 1279, when the treasurer and barons of the exchequer were ordered to cause to be levied the scutage for the army of Wales of the fifth year at the rate of 40s the fee from fees held of the king in chief, lands of minors in the king\'s wardship, escheats, honours in hand and royal purchases.  On the same day writs to collect were issued to the sheriffs who were to respond for the proceeds at the Exchequer in July 1279.This, the first scutage imposed for over 20 years, generated a far-reaching dispute which continued throughout the period during which attempts continued to be made to levy scutage. The disagreement arose out of a new attitude by the Exchequer, which now attempted to reimpose scutage on all a tenant-in-chief\'s fees, as well as demanding either active service or a fine for the reduced \'servicia debita\', whereas previous kings as far back as John had accepted a reduced level of service. This new imposition would mean that tenants would lose their own scutage, levied on their rear vassals, to the crown, whereas up until now they had been able to keep it; given the increased cost of equipping knights since the early days of scutage, their indignation was not unjustified. They argued furiously that the reduced service, accepted without question by Henry III, represented the true service owed because of the increased cost, and that the fines levied for failure to render this reduced service were very high (which they were). Thus, they argued, the crown was trying to secure payment for the same thing twice over. Nevertheless, the crown continued to try to impose these new conditions for over 50 years.Payment of the scutage was due by 24 June 1279. The Pipe Roll for 7 Edward I shows that few paid, since most tenants considered that they owed nothing, having either fined or served in 1277. The Exchequer, however, continued to charge the sums owed against them even when they obtained Chancery writs of quittance. The Courtenays, for example, obtained a writ but the Exchequer continued to try to exact payment until 1327. In fact, the attempt to levy scutage seems to bear little real relation to the campaign, but was seized on by Edward as a convenient way of generating additional income.(Helena M Chew, |Scutages and Aids in England, particularly in the Fourteenth Century| (unpublished MA thesis, London, 1921), pp 94-117; and |idem|., \'Scutage under Edward I\', |EHR|, XXXVIII (1922), pp 321-326).

4,1283 Jan 20 x Feb 28 ,thirtieth ,Edward I ,"The \'second\' Welsh war lasted from March 1282 until October 1283.  To finance this war, in June 1282 John de Kirkeby, archdeacon of Coventry, was commissioned to raise money by direct negotiation with towns and religious houses.  This probably failed to raise enough and, on 24 November 1282, the king, then at Rhuddlan, summoned two provincial parliaments of both clergy and laity to meet at York and Northampton on 20 January.The result for the laity was a grant of a thirtieth on moveables.  The goods exempt from the tax were as in 1275, and the minimum amount of property to be taxed was half a mark (6s 8d); people were to be assessed on the property that they held on 20 January.  The assessments were to be made by 12 neighbourhood jurors.  Later, clerics and merchants who had otherwise assisted in the war effort were declared exempt.Collectors were appointed on 28 February, and on 4 June they were instructed that the first half of the money was to be paid to the Constable of the Tower by 8 July and the second half by 13 October.G.L. Harriss has described the thirtieth of 1283, levied for the expedition to Wales, as \'the first national tax for war in the reign [of Edward I]\'.(G L Harriss, |King, Parliament and Public Finance|, pp 40-41, 71; Stubbs, |Select Charters|, p 424; |Parl.

6,1290 April 1 x Sept 22 ,"fifteenth levied in England, Wales and the Welsh Marches ",Edward I ,"In 1289 Edward I demanded an aid to meet the expenses of his war in Gascony over the previous three years.  This request was discussed in the long meeting of parliament which lasted from April to July 1290, and a commission for the assessment and collection of a fifteenth was issued from Clipstone on 22 September 1290.  The tax was to be collected at Easter and Michaelmas over the next two years, with payments due on 22 April and 29 September 1291, and 6 April and 29 September 1292.  It is likely that the grant was made, at least in part, in recognition of the expulsion of the Jews.The commissions set a threshold for assessment of 15s of goods, and also explicitly exempted a variety of items from assessment in rural districts: armour; riding-horses; the jewels and clothing of knights, gentlemen and their wives; and vessels of gold, silver and brass.  However, it was expressly stated that this exemption did not apply in cities, boroughs and other towns.  A writ was issued on or about 16 January 1291 for the assessment and collection of the fifteenth in London, and in further writs, dated 23 February, the taxers and collectors were ordered exempt certain items from taxation in towns: one garment each for a man and his wife, a bed for the two, one ring, one clasp of silver or gold, and a girdle of silk, if these were used daily, as well as a drinking cup of silver or mazer.  These exemptions were to become standard for all future taxes levied by Edward I (with the possible exception of 1301, when none were listed in the statute).Initially, Wales was not taxed, but on 20 January 1291 Edward I sent a request to the \'earls, barons, knights, free men and whole commonalty of Wales\' that they should also give him a fifteenth \'like the rest of the realm\'.  This was an attempt to extend sources of revenue, and the request was also made to the Welsh march and Ireland (qv), as well as Cheshire, in 1292.  Willard (p.27) states that the \'response to this request seems to have been generous, though no evidence has been found that it extended to the principality\' (sic).  However, R.R. Davies states that the tax raised perhaps £9,000-£10,000 from Wales, that is, from royal lands as well as from Marcher lordships, and views the tax as evidence of Edward I\'s determination to exert his authority over the March.  Evidence from the memoranda rolls gives some idea of clashes between the king and Marcher lords over the tax in at least one particular instance, that of the possessions of Edmund Mortimer in Wigmore.  Shropshire collectors had entered those lands before Mortimer had conceded to the king\'s request, and were adamant that his bailiff had impeded them in their duties (Fryde, p.9).  Assurances were duly given by the king to several Marcher lords that the tax they had granted was not to be used as a precedent, but a further tax was requested in 1300 (qv).  Contribution to the tax is clearly shown by surviving Welsh documents, listed by K. Williams-Jones (pp ix-x), which cover parts of Anglesey, Caernarfonshire and Merioneth, as well as several Marcher lordships.  The roll at E 179/242/48 (published in F. Jones (ed.), \'The Subsidy of 1292\') lists the taxers of the Welsh Marcher lordships, showing that many more rolls for those areas may have been created than are now extant.Entires in the memoranda rolls for later in the reign and afterwards show that there were difficulties in collecting the tax in parts of Wales.  In 1293, an examination of the returns for Wales and Cheshire was ordered, to discover the reasons for sums outstanding, \'as the assessors and collectors appear to have been negligent in the business\'.  In 1299, the taxers and collectors of the fifteenth in Flintshire gave the reason for their inability to collect part of the tax as being the war, presumably that of 1294-5 (Fryde, pp.18, 20).  Also in 1299, the order was made to distrain on individuals, presumably the collectors, from the cantrefs of Rhos and Rhufoniog (Denbighshire), to render their account (Fryde, p.19).  Arrears for Flintshire were still outstanding at that time, but the collectors were only exonerated from accounting for these in 1330, according to an entry in the Lord Treasurer\'s Memoranda Roll for 1330-1 (Fryde, p. 78).

7,1294 Nov 12 ,tenth and sixth ,Edward I ,"The assembly which met on 12 November 1294 granted, on the first day of the meeting, a tenth on moveables of all persons not exempt from the levy of the last fifteenth, in support of the war against the king of France for the recovery of Gascony.  One half was to be paid before the feast of the Purification (2 February 1295), the other before Pentecost following (22 May 1295), according to the appointment of named assessors and collectors issued at Westminster on the same day.On 21 November writs were issued commissioning men to request throughout the country a similar grant from the royal demesne, cities and other towns, there having been no representatives of the towns at the meeting.  Shortly afterwards, the men of London granted a sixth of moveables, and a commission for the assessment and collection of the sixth in London was issued on 26 November.  Many men serving in Gascony and Wales were declared exempt, at least temporarily, from payment, and writs of |supersedeas| were sent to the collectors from 13 November onwards, instructing them not to collect the sums due from these individuals, but to return into the Exchequer the assessments of what was due from them.  Some later paid in full, others were pardoned, and still others simply did not pay before the death of Edward I; it appears that they were not pressed for payment afterwards.The minimum value of taxable property was 10s. in the countryside, and 6s. in towns.  Property exempt from taxation was as in 1290, with the addition of treasure.The separation of the urban from the rural districts, and of charging the former at a higher rate, was an innovation which was to become standard.(|CPR 1292-1301|, pp.103-104; Willard, |Parliamentary Taxes on Personal Property|, pp.77-78, 111-113; Stubbs, |Select Charters|, pp.475-477) ",Origin  Granted,"1st: 1295 Feb 2, 2nd: 1295 May 22"

The king asked for a third or a fourth of clerical income, and a convocation was summoned on 27 November.  A period of difficult negotiations between the king and Robert Winchelsey, archbishop of Canterbury, followed, at the end of which a clerical tenth was granted by the clergy, with the promise of a further tenth in the next year, if the necessity of war remained.  In the event, however, the second tenth was not levied.  The tax was levied in both provinces, as the writs for collection make clear.The subsidy was levied in accordance with the \'|Taxatio| of 1291\'.

At the king\'s request, a group of the magnates present granted him an eighth and a fifth on moveable goods.  Commissions for collection were issued on 30 July; two collectors were appointed in each county, one of whom was non-resident there.  Sheriffs were ordered to assist in the collection, and taxpayers were to be assessed on the goods in their possession on 8 September 1297.  The levy of the tax met with opposition from the barons because of the irregularity of the assembly that had granted it, and the tax collectors had difficulties, forcing the king to appeal to a more comprehensive assembly for authority to levy the tax.In October 1297, a more representative parliament revoked the July grant and replaced it with a ninth.  However, judging by the expenses that they incurred, the assessors of the eighth and fifth had already begun their assessments by that time.(Stubbs, |Select Charters|, pp 485-486; |Parl.

In response, on 12 February 1297 Edward put the clergy outside his protection, and its outlawry proclaimed.  Instructions were issued to the sheriffs on 1 March stating that a fifth of clerical income, according to the \'|Taxatio| of 1291\', would be acceptable as a fine for buying back protection.  In effect, Edward was thus levying a fifth from the clergy.The York province was the first to submit (in January 1297), and individual members of the southern clergy soon after obtained letters of protection, from 19 February onwards.  The king, meanwhile, threatened to make the outlawry permanent.  At a meeting of Canterbury convocation at St Paul\'s on 21 March 1297 Winchelsey left the decision of whether to submit to individuals and most (though not the archbishop) capitulated.  Letters of protection issued to the clergy who submitted were enrolled on the patent roll.  Over 400 receipts issued to individual members of the clergy by the sheriffs, who were charged with collecting the fines, and related documents, are now C 81/1660B-C (formerly comprising C 47/21), and E 163/2/6-7. On 14 July 1297 Winchelsey and Edward were at last formally reconciled, and the archbishop\'s lands were restored to him.

12,1297 Oct 12 ,ninth ,Edward I ,"The parliament which met in October 1297 cancelled the July grant of an eighth and fifth and replaced it with a ninth, which was granted in return for confirmation of Magna Carta and the charter of the forest.  The |inspeximus| confirming the charters was issued on the 12th day of the month, which was, according to Harriss, the same day on which the ninth was granted.As in 1294, because the boroughs were not represented in the parliament, the commissions issued to taxers and collectors on 14 October did not cover cities and boroughs.  Subsequently, after the citizens of London had granted a ninth, the king\'s council ordained that the assessors and collectors in the counties should levy and collect the ninth in all cities, boroughs and royal demesne lands, and commissions were issued to that effect on 23 October.Exempt goods were as in 1296 and the minimum value of taxable goods was 9s.  Taxpayers were to be assessed on the goods that they held on 29 September 1297, and the money collected was to be delivered to the Exchequer in two halves - the first on the morrow of the feast of St Nicholas (7 December 1297), and the second on the morrow of the feast of the Purification (3 February 1298).In addition to the many assessments for the levy of this tax returned to the Exchequer surviving among the E 179 documents, the assessment of the borough of Grimsby, Lincolnshire, is held with the Grimsby borough records in the North East Lincolnshire Archives in Grimsby (ref: 1/611/1).(Harriss, |King, Parliament and Public Finance|, p 74; Willard, |Parliamentary Taxes on Personal Property|, p 88; |Parl.

23,1305 April 26 or earlier ,double scutage ,Edward I ,"The first full feudal summons after 1282 was issued on 30 December 1299 for an army to fight the Scots.  The muster was to be at Carlisle in the last week of June 1300.  Fines taken in lieu of service were collected at the unusually high rate of £40 per fee.The results of the campaign of 1300 fell much below the king\'s expectations, and two years later preparations were begun for a renewed conquest of Scotland.  Writs dated 7 November 1302 summoned another feudal host which was to assemble at Berwick-on-Tweed in the following May, and on 16 April 1303 the sheriffs were instructed by writ to make proclamation that all clerics, women and others unfit for service were to appear before Exchequer at York by 17 May to make fine with the king at the reduced rate of £20.Not until 1305 was there any attempt to raise scutage.  At the parliament which met at Westminster between February and April 1305 it was agreed that it should be collected for the armies for Scotland of both 28 and 31 Edward I.  The sheriffs were instructed at least as early as 7 November 1305 to proceed with the collection and to deliver the money to the Exchequer by the morrow of Hilary (14 January 1306).  Various entries upon both the Chancery and Exchequer rolls show that the collection was proceeding as early as December 1305 - January 1306, but there was great resistance to the levy of the tax and a general contumacy on the part of the sheriffs.On 15 January 1306, the day after the due payment date, when it was apparent that little money had been received, new instructions were issued to the sheriffs, ordering them to proceed with the collection and pay the moneys due into the Exchequer by 10 April, or face a fine of £40. The response was minimal, under £400 being raised in total. Collection was suspended in the summer of 1306 until a decision should be reached on the disputed matter of whether those who had performed service for their recognised fees were thereby quit of scutage on all fees. No further attempts were made to collect this double scutage during the power struggle between Edward II and his barons between 1307 and 1314.However, following the king\'s disastrous campaign of 1314, culminating in the defeat at Bannockburn, the crown\'s desperate need for money prompted reimposition of the collection of this double scutage, as well as a new retrospective scutage for the campaign of 1306. This time the sheriffs were bypassed, collectors for each county being appointed on 3 November 1314 (although the sheriffs were still required to assist the collectors in holding local inquisitions to establish fees held at midsummer 1300 and Whitsun 1303). No collection dates were specified, but the money was to be delivered in parcels as soon as possible. Collection was evidently still in progress in May 1315, when one collector was replaced. At the same time, sheriffs responsible for the collection of levies during the reign of Edward I were ordered to render account of the sums collected during their terms of office.In addition to the difficulties in collection created by the political tension of the period, and the accompanying deterioration of Exchequer administration, the continued failure of the crown and the magnates to reach agreement over the numbers of fees for which scutage was owed inevitably made this double scutage impossible to levy satisfactorily. In the parliament of January 1315 there were angry complaints, and the crown agreed to suspend collection until January 1316, while the magnates considered their response to the crown\'s offer to negotiate a compromise. When no response had been made by the end of the respite period, collection was restarted, and distraints were enforced.Nevertheless, and despite continuing attempts to collect the scutage for the next 25 years, it was never possible to collect all the sums believed by the Exchequer to be outstanding.  Eventually the continued determination of the magnates to oppose the Exchequer\'s appraisal of the incidence of the levy bore fruit in 1340.  Little had in any case been collected; in return for a grant of taxation, Edward III agreed to abandon attempts at collection, and magnates received a pardon of all outstanding debts, including scutages, prior to January 1336.(|Parl.

26,1301 Jan 20 or later ,fifteenth ,Edward I ,"In March 1300 Parliament granted a twentieth on the understanding that certain reforms be undertaken, especially that perambulations of the forests should be carried out, and an |inspeximus| was issued for each charter on 28 March.  However, no writs were issued for assessment or collection of the tax, and the matter remained in abeyance until another Parliament met at Lincoln on 20 January 1301.  At this assembly, a fifteenth was substituted for the twentieth, on the condition that grievances, especially those concerned with the forests, be remedied.  No taxers and collectors could be appointed, however, until Michaelmas, because of the Scottish campaign.Because of its financial difficulties, the crown employed the same technique that it had made use of in 1282.  Officials equipped with details of the assessment of the last fifteenth approached 59 towns to persuade them to compound for the fifteenth by making prompt payment of a lump sum.  At least 15 towns agreed.Orders dated 8 October at Stirling were issued to sheriffs and communities of counties for the election of three or four knights, or others, to serve as assessors and collectors.  Commissions to the chosen assessors were issued between 24 October and 12 November.  The instructions contained no exemption clauses, but after consideration by the king and magnates, a privy seal writ was sent on 23 November to the treasurer and barons of the Exchequer ordering them to restore the list of exemptions that were in force for past taxes.  It was not until 9 December, however, that a writ to that effect was issued under the seal of the Exchequer and sent to the commissioners.  There appears to have been no threshold of liability of taxable property.The collection dates varied.  In York, for example, the tax money collected was to be delivered to the Exchequer on the morrow of Martinmas (12 Nov 1301), the quinzaine of the following Easter (6 May 1302), and the quinzaine of the nativity of John the Baptist thereafter (8 July 1302).  In Kent, the assessment for Dartford gives Michaelmas (29 September) 1301 as the date for payment, while the attached schedule of assessments of the collectors cites Michaelmas 1302 (E 179/123/4).  Elsewhere in Kent, collectors seem to have been at work between April and June 1302 (E 179/237/52).The king\'s need for money at the opening of the Scottish campaign in March 1301 was so acute, however, that he could not wait for these payments to come due, but resorted in the mean time to \'an irregular anticipation of the revenues\'.  In August 1301, after 2,500 marks had been procured in July as a loan from the city of London by John Drokensford, keeper of the king\'s wardrobe, commissions were issued to officials and men of 57 of the larger towns in England, requesting that they solicit loans in anticipation of the fifteenth.  Drokensford and other officials were also ordered to travel to these towns and treat with individuals there for similar loans.  A number of loans were raised in this way.(|CCR 1296-1302|, pp 461-463; Willard, |Parliamentary Taxes on Personal Property|, pp 23-24) ",Origin  Granted,
27,1301 Feb 26 ,three papal tenths ,Edward I ,"On 26 February 1301 Pope Boniface VIII imposed a tenth on the English clergy for three years.  The avowed purpose of the tax was to help the Roman church meet the expenses incurred in Sicily.  Even though half of the proceeds were intended to aid Edward I, the papal bull made no mention of this, which was later to cause problems and raises suspicions as to the pope\'s ulterior motives.Boniface appointed Richard Gravesend, bishop of London, and Bartholomew of Ferentino as principal collectors.  They published their commission on 27 July 1301, and appointed deputy collectors in September and October 1301.  The Templars and Hospitallers were declared exempt from the levy, and the threshold of liability for the tax was reduced from the customary six marks of income to seven pounds of Tours (livres Tournois) (deemed equivalent to two marks). The tax was to be paid twice annually on 30 November and 16 January.Before the payment of the second instalment fell due on 16 January 1302, the collectors were ordered by the king to suspend collection, and he questioned the pope\'s right to levy a tax on temporalities by papal mandate. The real reason for the king\'s objection is not entirely clear, but it was probably the pope\'s failure to make a formal grant enabling him to receive half of the tenth, which he had been promised. When the king tried to secure this promised half, the pope\'s collectors refused to pay him any of the proceeds until he issued his letters of obligation, undertaking to repay what had been received by his officers. At length, the king decided to issue such letters of obligation, and a list of the receipts made by his officers of the first two years of these tenths (totalling over £12,700) cites the letters given in each case (E 179/42/2A). Once the pope had formally granted him half of the collection on 12 March 1302, the resumption of the collection of the tax on both spiritualities and temporalities proceeded.The delay meant that the second payment was collected in arrears, and an even more serious problem was the lowering of the threshold of liability from six to two marks of income, because these poorer benefices had not been valued by the |Taxatio| of 1291 and had to be assessed. This valuation was made in the autumn of 1302 and beginning of 1303.  In the north, moreover, the assessment made in the |Taxatio| of 1291 had to be revised slightly because of the destruction caused by the marauding Scots; the values of some churches were reduced by a third and others were exempted entirely.The death of Boniface VIII on 11 October 1303 profoundly affected the collection of the third year of the tax.  One would expect that collection of the tax should cease at the pope\'s death, but Edward I claimed that Boniface had granted him all the proceeds of the tenth which might remain at the time of his death.  He ordered the collectors, therefore, to pay these proceeds into his wardrobe and to render account for them at the Exchequer, together with lists of delinquent payers.  He also appropriated to himself the papal right of excommunication to compel payment by defaulters.  In effect, although the papal collectors remained nominally in charge, the final year and arrears of the tax were administered by the crown, and the king ended up with far more than the half promised by Boniface. A large file of acquittances given to the collectors in various dioceses by the keeper of the king\'s wardrobe, John de Drokensford, is now E 179/67/3A. Upon his election in 1305, Pope Clement V charged his legate William Testa with the task of trying to recover the proceeds of the third year of the triennial tenth, but the latter was unsuccessful.  Under an agreement reached between Edward II and the pope in 1309, the crown was allowed to keep all the proceeds of the final year and subsequent receipts were to be shared between king and pope.  Arrears were still being collected in 1317.The triennial tenth imposed by Boniface VIII set an important precedent in the history of both papal and royal taxation.  For the first time the king had obtained a share of the taxes levied by papal mandate without promising to undertake a crusade, and this arrangement, which was to be repeated, proved useful when he was faced with a clergy which refused to grant him the subsidies he required.

28,1303 July 1 x 1304 Jan 20 ,tallage ,Edward I ,"The king\'s need for money led the Exchequer to suggest reviving the tallage, particularly after the English merchants had refused to pay the |Nova Customa| in June 1303.  In the following month, John Drokensford, keeper of the king\'s wardrobe, reported to the council that the king was favourable to the scheme.Commissions for collection of the tax were issued between 20 January and 6 February 1304.  Although traditionally sheriffs were charged with levying tallages, commissioners were appointed for groups of counties, and were instructed to assess the tax on either communities or individuals.  The method of assessment was left to their discretion, provided that they \'neither spared the rich nor oppressed the poor\'.J.F. Hadwin speculated that the levy of fractional taxes on moveable goods, which had become the most usual form of lay tax, made an impact on the way in which this tallage was assessed.  Some assessors assessed landed revenue separately from moveables, and in London, \'the assessments alleged to be specified fractions of the taxpayers\' wealth\'.  One annalist claimed that London paid a tenth on revenues and a fifteenth on moveables. The first payment, from York, was made on 28 February 1304, and by the end of the calendar year over £4,000 had been collected.  Thereafter the remainder was slow to come in, as an assessment of Rochester and Strood in Kent attests.  An endorsement on that document notes that it was returned to the Exchequer in October 1304, and a subsequent annotation reveals that the whole sum assessed was paid on 22 June 1312 (E 179/123/7).Receipts of the tax were recorded on special receipt rolls (E 401/1677, 1683, 1693, 1698 and 1705), and some assessments survive in the E 179 class of documents.  Arrears are noted on the pipe rolls of Edward II, and were transferred to the exannual rolls in the 1320s (E 363/1-3).  An enrolled account, which was originally attached to the pipe roll for 1306-7, also survives.  Eventually over £5,000, and possibly as much as £6,000, was collected.  The total assessments for each county and borough are printed by Hadwin.(J.F. Hadwin, \'The Last Royal Tallages\', |EHR| 96 (1981), pp 344-358)enrolled account: E 372/152B ",Origin  Imposed,
120,1286 Sept 6 or later ,three clerical thirtieths from York province ,Edward I ,"In a letter of 11 October 1283 to Archbishop Wickwane, the king had asked the province of York to grant him a subsidy, but unlike their counterparts in the province of Canterbury, which granted a twentieth for three years in the following November, the northern clergy was apparently able to put the king off with the promise of a future grant.  On 6 September 1286, however, John le Romeyne, who had succeeded Wickwane as archbishop in the previous year, summoned a convocation of the clergy of the province for this purpose, citing the king\'s letter to his predecessor.The northern clergy granted a thirtieth for three years, to be assessed according to the 1254 \'Valuation of Norwich\'.  The tax was to be paid by the clergy of Durham diocese also.  Archbishop Romeyne issued orders on 3 July 1287 for collection of the tax, to be paid yearly in two instalments, on 24 June and 25 December.Walter of Maidstone was appointed to audit the accounts of the collectors on 21 July 1289 and to collect arrears.  Arrears continued to be collected for some years, possibly as late as 1294.(Wilkins, |Concilia|, II, p 127; Deighton, \'Clerical Taxation by Consent, 1279-1301\', pp 167-169) ",Origin  Granted,"1st: 1287 Jun 24, 2nd: 1287 Dec 25, 3rd: 1288 Jun 24, 4th: 1288 Dec 25, 5th: 1289 Jun 24, 6th: 1289 Dec 25"
125,1273 Jan 19 or earlier ,two papal tenths ,Edward I ,"On 3 September 1272 Pope Gregory X asked the English clergy to grant a tenth of the incomes from their spiritualities and temporalities for two years to enable the Lords Edward and Edmund to meet expenses incurred while on crusade.  His letter to the bishops and prelates was in the form of a request rather than a mandate.  It was not until the onset of Edward I\'s reign that the clergy of Canterbury province complied; the letter announcing their approval was dated 19 January 1273.  A similar grant was made by the province of York probably soon after.  The proceeds from the levy of the first year were to be used for Edward I\'s expenses and the those of the second were earmarked for Edmund.  On the pope\'s instructions the Templars, Hospitallers, Cistercians, Premonstratensians and order of Sempringham were exempted from the levy.The tax was to be levied according to the assessment made in the \'Valuation of Norwich\' of 1254, and administered by the papal legates Raymond de Nogaret, the pope\'s chaplain, and Pierre d\'Aussone, canon of St Martin of Tours.  They were to hold the proceeds on deposit at the New Temple in London and inform the pope of the total amounts collected.  They had the power to excommunicate anyone who delayed payment or defaulted, and also could (and did) distrain taxpayers\' goods to compel payment.The two legates set the levy in motion on 1 February 1273 with a letter to each bishop, which was to be announced to the abbots, priors, deans, archdeacons and other exempt and non-exempt clergy in their diocese.  Deputy collectors were appointed in each diocese, usually archdeacons.  Payment of the first year\'s levy was to be made in two equal payments on 16 April and 24 June, but for the second year, all was to be collected in one tranche by the end of 1273, or before 21 March 1274 at the latest.Some taxpayers compounded for their temporalities, possibly because they had not been valued in 1254.  There was apparently a certain amount of double charging in cases where wealthier clergy paid for all their estates, spread over different collectorates, in one place, to be sorted out.  The legates asked for the help of the royal government in the administration of the tax, which played a bigger role than was customary in the levy of a purely papal tax.  On 12 August 1273 a royal clerk was appointed to assist the papal collectors, and sheriffs and bailiffs of liberties made exactions from delinquent debtors.  Arrears in 1275 and 1276 were collected by two king\'s clerks expressly charged with this task.Despite the pope\'s instructions, the money collected was paid either into the royal exchequer or wardrobe, or directly to the king\'s creditors, on the authority of royal writs.  In a few cases, the taxpayer paid the king himself.  It was the king who profited wholly from the levy; his brother Edmund did not receive the yield of the second year as intended, even though the pope wrote to the king urging him to share the proceeds.The total receipts have been estimated at £22,000.(Wilkins, |Concilia|, II, p 24; Lunt, \'Consent of the English Lower Clergy to Taxation During the Reign of Henry III\', p 164; |CCR 1272-1279|, p 79; Lunt, |Financial Relations of the Papacy with England to 1327|, pp 230-238; Deighton, \'Clerical Taxation by Consent, 1279-1301\', pp 161-2) ",Origin  Granted,"1st: 1273 Apr 16, 2nd: 1273 Jun 24, 3rd: 1274 Mar 21"
126,1274 May 18 ,six papal tenths for a crusade ,Edward I ,"In the second session of the Council of Lyons, held on 18 May 1274, Pope Gregory X imposed a levy of a tenth on the income of all clergy for six years in support of a crusade to the Holy Land.  The levy was to begin on 24 June 1274.Exemptions were granted to the Templars, the Hospitallers, the Teutonic Knights, the Augustinian enclosed sisters, and those clerks who were pledged to go on the next crusade.  The Cistercians were initially declared exempt, but the pope later changed the policy, putting instead a ceiling of 100,000 pounds (of Tours) on their contribution.Two papal legates were put in charge of the collection in England: Raymond de Nogaret of Agen and John of Darlington, a former confessor to Henry III.  Two deputies were to be chosen in each diocese.  Far more detailed instructions were issued regarding the assessment than had been issued for the levy of any previous papal tax, exempting various categories of income, mostly to do with the sustenance of the poor.In the event, the collectors did not begin their work until after the first payment was due, since copies of their commission were not sent to the bishops for publication until 31 January 1275, and collection began in some places only in March 1275.  The new assessment was not made until early in 1276, and taxpayers were expected to pay the difference between the two assessments after its completion.  Under powers granted to them on 30 August 1275, the papal legates were given authority to make taxpayers swear on oath (rather than according to conscience) to the valuation of their estates and often did. The two collectors in the diocese of Worcester, for example, ordered the dean of Kidderminster to cause all clergy in the city of Worcester to come before them in the cathedral on 12-13 February 1276, and make oath as to the value of their goods (E179/58/1).  This form of assessment raised a storm of protest, as did other contentious provisions, and the clergy petitioned the pope on these issues, asking that the 1254 \'Valuation of Norwich\' be used as the basis for the levy.  Although he relented on some of the provisions of the new assessment, on this point he would not give in.Many of the provisions of the assessment caused grief to both the collectors and the taxpayers, but it was undoubtedly a more careful and thorough exercise than any which had gone before.  Copies of the assessments of the income from the abbeys of Glastonbury and Bury St Edmunds and the diocese of Ely survive in monastic and episcopal registers, and have been printed by Lunt in |Valuation of Norwich|, pp 551-559. It has been estimated that the tax raised more than double the tenth levied according to the \'Valuation of Norwich\' in 1254, almost £21,000 annually, despite mounting arrears for each year of the levy.  Summaries of papal accounts now in the Vatican archives have been printed by Lunt in \'A Papal Tenth Levied in the British Isles from 1274 to 1280\', pp 50-61.In accordance with papal instructions, the proceeds were held in local repositories such as cathedrals and monastic churches, but were increasingly placed on deposit with firms of Italian bankers, whose accounts were audited on the orders of Pope Martin IV in 1284.Any king who took the cross was offered the yield of the tenth within his dominions, and Edward I accordingly secured the grant of the tenth of England, Wales and Ireland, and that of Scotland as well, if the king of Scotland would agree, in return for his promise to participate in a crusade, but no money was to be paid until he was ready to embark.  It became increasingly impossible for him to go, but the temptation of the papal coffers proved too much, and he ordered the seizure of the tenth deposited in churches and monasteries on 28 March 1283, probably for use in his Welsh war.  A papal legate was sent to order him to return it, and with the Welsh war nearly over, he gave it back virtually untouched.  Some years later, following prolonged negotiations, he was granted one of the tenths.(W E Lunt, \'A Papal Tenth Levied in the British Isle from 1274 to 1280\', |EHR|, XXXII (1917), pp 49-89; Lunt, |Financial Relations of the Papacy with England to 1327|, pp 311-346) ",Origin  Imposed,"1st: 1274 Dec 25, 2nd: 1275 Jun 24, 3rd: 1275 Dec 25, 4th: 1276 Jun 24, 5th: 1276 Dec 25, 6th: 1277 Jun 24, 7th: 1277 Dec 25, 8th: 1278 Jun 24, 9th: 1278 Dec 2510th: 1279 Jun 2411st: 1279 Dec 251, 2nd: 1280 Jun 24"

The southern clergy met again on 20 October, and remained defiant still, but soon after made a grant of a twentieth for three years.The tax was administered by the same machinery set up to collect the 1280 clerical taxes, and was probably also levied in accordance with the 1254 \'Valuation of Norwich\'.  The dates by which the tax was to be paid are not known.Most of the proceeds appear to have been paid before the grant of the next clerical tenth in 1290, but small arrears continued to be levied from some dioceses for many years.Deighton, \'Clerical Taxation by Consent, 1279-1301\', pp 165-167.

Writs issued to sheriffs on 22 June authorized the payment of fines in lieu of service at a rate of 50 marks the fee, on the fees of the new service.When Edward returned from the west in May 1285, a parliament was held in London, in consultation with which it was decided to levy a scutage in connection with the Welsh campaign, at a rate of 40s per fee.As with the previous scutage, the Exchequer policy of charging tenants-in-chief with both fines (or service) at the reduced service quota, and scutage on the old service quota, created discontent. In 1292 there were petitions for remedy in Parliament, but this only prompted the Exchequer to cling more stubbornly to its position. The dispute was still going on in 1305, but it appears that the collection of both the Welsh scutages was suspended for the last years of Edward\'s reign.(Helena M Chew, |Scutages and Aids in England, particularly in the Fourteenth Century| (unpublished MA thesis, London, 1921), pp 106-110; and |idem|., \'Scutage under Edward I\', |EHR|, XXXVII (1922), pp 321-326).

This tax was to be collected by ecclesiastical persons according to an assessment, method and form to be ordained by the pope.On 18 March 1291 Nicholas IV appointed John of Pontoise, bishop of Winchester, and Oliver Sutton, bishop of Lincoln, as principal assessors and collectors of the tax in England and Wales.  They were to collect the tenths for six years from 24 June, on the understanding that the king would set out on that date in 1293.  They were to assess the true value of ecclesiastical income in accordance with regulations almost identical to those used for the assessment of 1276, and with the advice of discreet men of each diocese.  The principal collectors were to exact an oath from both the assessors and collectors that they would perform their duties faithfully.  They met with the king\'s treasurer William March at the New Temple in London on 31 August 1291, and on the following day published the papal bulls concerning the assessment and collection of the tax.  The two principal collectors continued to associate closely with the treasurer and used the facilities of the royal Exchequer to transcribe and disseminate copies of the bull and assessment rolls. The principal collectors ordered the bishops of each diocese to appoint assessors and send them to London for instructions.  The assessors then returned to their dioceses, met with the clergy in each deanery, and began compiling their lists of the values of all spiritual income in the autumn of 1291.  Their task was to value the spiritual income only, which included the income from churches appropriated to monasteries.  The assessment of clerical temporalities was made by different assessors, who were, for the most part, cathedral canons working in dioceses other than their own, and their work was much more controversial and attracted more criticism than that of the assessors of spiritualities.  Some chroniclers claimed that the assessors of temporalities doubled, tripled and even quadrupled assessments in an arbitrary fashion, and some re-assessments were made after bitter complaints. The papal instructions set out in detail all items of income which were to be assessed, down to the smallest oblations for burials, marriages and penances, and all items to be exempted, including, for example, oblations for the fabric of the church.  No tax was to be paid, moreover, from the revenue of leper houses, houses of God or hospitals, whose income had been converted to the use of the sick and poor.  Poor nuns of meagre income were also not taxed, nor were bequests and voluntary gifts made to churches or clergymen.  Any benefice holder whose total income was less than 6 marks (or 4 pounds) was also declared exempt, but if a benefice holder derived an income of more than 6 marks from several benefices, no matter how small the income from each, every separate item of income had to be assessed.  One loophole concerned the taxation of vicarages.  The full value of a church was to be assessed, including any vicarage, but the tax fell on the holder of the benefice, that is, the rector, who was to be assessed for the whole income of the church without deducting the vicar\'s portion.  In practice, however, the assessors appear to have treated the income of each vicar separately, and if his total income was less than 6 marks, the vicarage from which he derived his income would escape taxation.  Also exempt from the tenth were the Templars and Hospitallers, although the Cistercians were taxed, and deputy collectors of the tax whose revenues were 100 marks per annum or less did not pay the tenth.  This assessment proved to be the basis of all clerical taxation in England from 1291 to 1523, as the many transcripts of the 1291 assessments now among the E 179 documents attest.The detailed papal instructions for the assessment of the tax are printed in Wilkins, |Concilia|, II, pp 180-183.  The assessment of England and Wales is printed in |Taxatio Ecclesiastica Angliae et Walliae Auctoritate Nicholai IV|, ed. T Astle, S Ayscough and J Caley (London, 1802).  This edition was derived chiefly from 14th-15th cent. Exchequer transcripts now in PRO, E 164/13-14, with variant readings from BL, Cotton MS Tiberius C.x and the various transcripts of assessments in E 179.  Recent editions of portions of the assessment, edited or collated from other manuscript sources, include: J H Denton, \'The 1291 Valuation of the Churches of Ely Diocese\', |Proceedings of the Cambridge Antiquarian Society|, XC (2001), pp 75-80; M J Franklin, \'The Assessment of Benefices for Taxation in 13th Century Buckinghamshire\', |Nottingham Medieval Studies|, XXIX (1985), pp 86-98; and J H Denton and B Taylor, \'The 1291 Valuation of the Ecclesiastical Benefices of Llandaff Diocese\', |Archaeologia Cambrensis|, CXLVII (1998), pp 143-152. The tax revenue was to be kept by the deputy collectors on deposit in safe places until the king fulfilled certain conditions, upon which it was to be delivered to him.  They were to write all payments in a register, which would form the basis of an annual report rendered in the autumn of each year to the principal collectors.After the sixth instalment had become due on 3 May 1294, the collection of the tenth was suspended for the three remaining years, due to the heavy burden of clerical taxes levied by Edward I in these years, although the arrears of previous years continued to be collected.  On 10 June 1296 the bishop of Lincoln was replaced as a principal collector by the papal legate Geoffrey of Vezzano, and an account for the first three years was rendered to the pope by the principal collectors accordingly.  Geoffrey and the bishop of Winchester continued to collect arrears of the tax until 16 March 1300, when they were succeeded by Robert de Elenton, abbot of Waltham, and Ralph Baldock, dean of St Paul\'s, to whom they rendered an account.The new collectors resumed collection of the remaining years of the tax, issuing commissions to deputy collectors on 19 October 1300, who in turn notified the clergy that payments for the fourth year of the tax would be due on 27 January and 16 April 1301.  Pope Boniface VIII later countermanded the mandate for collection of the tax for the fourth year because a new papal tenth for three years had been ordered on 26 February 1301, but the dean of St Paul accounted on 8 August 1302 for the revenue which had been collected for the fourth year before collection had been halted.  The collectors of the triennial tenth granted in 1301 thereafter took charge of the administration of the arrears of the sextennial tenth until 1304, when responsibility was transferred to Gerard of Pecorara, who had been appointed collector of all papal revenues in England by Pope Benedict XI.  Arrears of the fourth tenth continued to be paid until at least 1328, but not much was received after 1312.  The final two years of the tax were never levied.

Some magnates had already granted a fifteenth before the general request issued in letters patent on 26 October .  On 28 October, the Irish clergy were asked to give a tenth of their spiritualities.The subsidy was granted and collected within and outside the Pale and was paid into the Irish exchequer; it seems unlikely, therefore, that any records will be found in the E 179 class.(|CPR 1281-1292|, pp 446-449); J.R.

Presumably this would have been collected, and accounted for, by the Irish Exchequer and one would not expect records arising from it (if any) to exist in the E 179 class.

133,1300 May 21 or earlier ,tax levied in Wales ,Edward I ,"In the spring of 1300 a tax was levied in Wales which, according to Michael Prestwich, was a tax of a fifteenth, although an entry in the Close rolls for 1307 refers to \'the twentieth granted to the king\'s father, before he gave to the present king the land of Wales ...\'.  Whatever the fraction, the crown realised at least £2,776 from the levy, \'not including what was raised in the Marches\'.  Although the tax was not granted by parliament, and no record of it is found on the parliament roll, several documentary references state that the men of Wales had \'granted [it] of their own free will\'.According to letters of credence issued on 1 April 1300 and directed to the \'knights, good men and whole commonalty\' of West and North Wales, Edward had issued instructions to John de Havering, justice of Wales, \'by word of mouth, touching a subsidy for the present Scotch war\'.  Further letters of credit were issued on 21 May 1300, directed to the communities of other royal possessions in Wales, comprising Southern Powys, Englefield, Flint and Rhuddlan, the county of Flint, Ellesmere, the cantref of Builth and Montgomery, with instructions issued to John de Havering as before, Richard de Mascy, justice of Chester, Philip Aphowel, constable of Builth and Bogo de Knovill, constable of Montgomery castle.   An entry on the close roll dated 7 June 1300 reveals that 2,000 marks was offered by the men of North Wales for this purpose, and that the king understood that the men of other areas, comprising Englefield, Flint and Rhuddlan, Builth and Montgomery, and including South Wales, would \'aid him voluntarily in like manner on this occasion\'.  These letters were apparently sent to the commonalty ordering the men of those areas to obey the various royal officials, who were to levy the \'good and suitable aid upon this occasion by all means in [their] power\' in those areas.  Richard de Havering, the justice\'s son, was appointed receiver of the Welsh subsidy a little over a month later (on 10 July).  He was instructed to take the money directly to the king in Scotland, while his father John was ordered to \'hasten the collection, as the king is in great need of money at present\'.  No payment date was specified in the letters; Richard was to inform the contributors of a date and place of payment; his account for the proceeds, totalling £2,776 13s 4d, may be found at E 372/150 m 43d (see Natalie Fryde, \'Councils and Consent in Medieval Wales circa 1200-1327\', |Album Francois Dumont| (Brussels, 1977), Studies presented to the International Commission for the History of Representative and Parliamentary Institutions 60).  This may not represent the full amount collected, however, as an entry in the Memoranda rolls for Michaelmas term, 1301, shows that an assignment of £4000 was made on the proceeds of \'the fifteenth to be levied in the Marches\', to pay Welsh foot soldiers for their service in Scotland.  However, there were clearly problems in carrying out these instructions, as in January 1303, according to another entry in the Memoranda rolls, the threat of distraint on their property hung over the collectors unless this assignment was made.There are indications that the clergy paid this tax as well.  On 21 September 1300, in letters patent addressed to the \'bishops, abbots, priors and whole commonalty\' of North and West Wales, the king promised that the \'goodwill\' subsidy should not be made a precedent, and that he would issue letters patent to that effect.  No trace of these promised letters has, however, been found.  At the same time, the king also thanked those who had contributed in North and West Wales, Flintshire, Builth, Montgomery and Southern Powys.No documents recording the collection of this tax have been found, and in view of the fact that the Exchequer was not involved in the first instance, and that the money collected was delivered directly to the king on campaign, it seems unlikely that any will come to light among Exchequer records, although later stages in the accounting procedure are noted, as mentioned above.(|CCR 1296-1302|, p 354; CCR 1307-1313, p 3; |CPR 1292-1301|, pp 503, 517-518, 526, 534; M.

The clergy of the Canterbury province met at Ely on 2 October 1290 to consider his request and made a grant of a tenth, in return, it was said, for his expulsion of the Jews.The tax was to be levied according to the 1254 \'Valuation of Norwich\' and paid in two instalments.  The first half was apparently due at Whitsuntide (10 June) 1291, and the second perhaps at Michaelmas, as was the case in the levy of the tenth granted by the northern province.This is the first clerical subsidy for which records of the receipt of the proceeds were entered in the receipt rolls of the Exchequer (E 401), and these record a total of £1732 1s. 8d. as having been received, from Easter 1291 to Easter 1295, after which minor arrears continued to be paid.(Wilkins, |Concilia|, II, p 174; Deighton, \'Clerical Taxation by Consent, 1279-1301\', pp 169-171) ",Origin  Granted,"1st: 1291 Jun 10, 2nd: 1291 Sep 29 (?)"
158,1290 Dec 16 or earlier ,clerical tenth from York province ,Edward I ,"In the summer of 1290, Edward I asked for subsidies from both the laity and the clergy.  Following the grant of a tenth by the clergy of the Canterbury province, which met at Ely on 2 October 1290, the clergy of the northern convocation assembled and made a like grant.  Their grant was announced to the king by a letter from Archbishop Romeyne on 16 December 1290.  In early January 1291, the clergy of Durham diocese met and agreed to contribute on the same terms.As in the south, the tax was to be paid according to the 1254 \'Valuation of Norwich\' and collected in two instalments.  The first moiety was payable at Easter (22 April) 1291 and the second at Michaelmas (29 September) 1291.Unlike the tax collected in Canterbury province, the receipts of which were recorded in the Exchequer receipt rolls, only one entry appears relating to the northern collection, probably because the proceeds were received and expended in the north.(Wilkins, |Concilia|, II, p 174; Deighton, \'Clerical Taxation By Consent, 1279-1301\', pp 169-171)  ",Origin  Granted,"1st: 1291 Apr 22, 2nd: 1291 Sep 29"
159,1294 Sept 23 x 30 ,clerical moiety ,Edward I ,"Needing funds for his war in France, Edward I summoned the clergy of both provinces to meet on 21 September 1294.  Already he had alarmed them by, among other things, seizing and enrolling, on 4 July, all the coined money and treasures in the sacristies of the monasteries and cathedrals. On the third day of the meeting they offered him two tenths for one year, but he demanded half their entire revenue or else he would outlaw them, and they were obliged to submit. Their request that sole benefices worth 10 marks per annum and less be exempted from the tax was, however, granted.Writs for collection were issued on 30 September, appointing collectors in each diocese, and ordering payment to be made in three instalments, on 1 November 1294, and 17 April and 8 July 1295. The proceeds were to be kept in a safe place until further orders.The tax was the first royal tax to be levied on the basis of the \'|Taxatio| of 1291\', and the collectors had to seek out the taxation rolls from the two chief assessors, the bishops of Winchester and Lincoln. A well-preserved assessment of the diocese of Salisbury is now E 179/52/1A.Defaulters and delinquent payers were pursued vigorously, but it has been estimated that 75% of the tax had been collected by September 1295. Subsequent arrears tended to be collected with those from the levy of the clerical tenth of 1295 (E 179/52/1; E 179/55/1-4).Approximately £105,000 was raised by the levy.(|CPR 1292-1301|, p 89; Deighton, \'Clerical Taxation By Consent, 1279-1301\', pp 171-175) ",Origin  Imposed,"1st: 1294 Nov 1, 2nd: 1295 Apr 17, 3rd: 1295 Jul 8"
160,1297 Nov 20 ,clerical tenth from Canterbury province ,Edward I ,"In the autumn of 1297 the invasion of the Scots gave a fresh urgency to the king\'s pleas for subsidies.  On 15 October 1297 the archbishop of Canterbury summoned a convocation of the southern province to meet on 20 November.  The clergy escaped both royal and papal censure by voting a subsidy before being asked.Both the higher and lower clergy were represented in convocation, the latter by two proctors from each English diocese and one proctor from each Welsh diocese, and the grant that they made perhaps reflects this wider representation.  A tenth was granted, but whereas that paid by the archbishops, bishops, cathedral chapters and monasteries was to be levied according to the |Taxatio| of 1291, the tenth paid by the parish clergy was to be based upon the less severe 1254 \'Valuation of Norwich\'.  The religious orders which were usually exempt (i.e., the Templars and the Hospitallers) were informed that since they had been represented at the convocation, they were bound to pay the tenth also, and the alien priories, too, were included in the grant, as were hospitals and poor nunneries, although bishops had discretion in reducing the contribution of the latter.  It is possible that the tax replaced the earlier third or fifth in the same way that the lay ninth replaced the eighth and fifth.The archbishop\'s writ for collection, dated 4 December 1297, requested payment of the first half by 13 January and the second half by 16 March 1298, but in a subsequent letter to the bishop of Lincoln he stated that, in view of the national emergency, he was raising loans on the strength of the first instalment and urged the richer clergy and religious houses to pay both instalments of the tax at once.Once the immediate crisis of the war with the Scots had passed, the clergy ceased to pay the subsidy.  When, in June 1298, Edward I asked for the balance of the tax to be paid, the Canterbury convocation replied that, now that the emergency had ended, no further payment could be made without papal permission.(|Reg.

However, it was probably in the latter part of 1273, since in February 1274 permission was being given to individual Jews to sell their houses in order to meet their tallage debts. This tallage was later referred to as \'the great tallage of 2 Edward I\' when, on 28 June 1278, instructions were issued concerning the levy of arrears.(|CPR 1272-1281|, pp 42, 43, 273).

165,1305 Aug 1 ,seven papal tenths ,Edward I ,"At the earliest opportunity available to him, Edward I sought the grant of further papal tenths from Pope Clement V, sending envoys to him for this purpose on 17 June 1305. On 1 August 1305, the pope acceded to his request and ordered the English church to pay an annual tenth for the next seven years.  Although it was publicly stated that the tax was being levied for the needs of the Holy Land, only some of the revenue was intended for this purpose.The receipts from the first year were granted to Edward I, those of the second year were for Prince Edward, and the yield of the next five years were earmarked for Edward I, although £2,000 from each of the six years of the levy granted to the king were pledged to defraying the costs of the charity dispensed by Queen Margaret.  Later, on 16 January 1307, the pope reserved a quarter of the revenue due to Edward I for the last four years of the tax to himself \'for the burdens and necessities of the Roman church\' (Rymer, |Foedera|, I, pp 1007-1008).Although the tenths were to run for successive years, they were imposed as three separate taxes.  The bishops of Lincoln and London were appointed as principal collectors of all three by three different letters, all containing much the same provisions.  The first tax was a tenth for two years, beginning on 1 November 1305, the second was also a tenth for two years, beginning on the same date in 1307, and the third a tenth for three years, beginning on 1 November 1309.The first tenth began to be collected on 21 April 1306, when the principal collectors received their commission.  They sent copies to the bishops of each diocese for publication and began to appoint deputy collectors, ordering the tenth to be paid in two equal instalments before 24 June and 25 December in each year, and the delivery of the receipts on the following 16 July and 16 January.  After the payment of the first instalment, however, the three payment dates of the remainder of the first tenth were brought forward to 7 December 1306 and 8 May and 1 December 1307, by royal mandate.  Edward I interfered with the collection, issuing his own orders to the deputy collectors, and instructing them to pay the proceeds directly to royal agents and creditors, or into the royal wardrobe and Exchequer, instead of to the papal collectors. The death of Edward I on 7 July 1307 invalidated the remaining grants, and although the pope granted whatever arrears were due from the first tenth to Edward II, the second biennial tenth was never levied.  Edward I had received some £14,778 of the yield of the first year before his death.  The collectors were ultimately charged with collecting over £20,375 for the first tenth; they rendered their final account in 1315.(W E Lunt, \'Clerical Tenths Levied in England by Papal Authority During the Reign of Edward II\', |Anniversary Essays in Mediaeval History by Students of Charles Homer Haskins| (Boston and New York, 1929), pp 157-161; Lunt, |Financial Relations of the Papacy with England to 1327|, pp 382-385)Enrolled Account: E 359/3, rot. 1 ",Origin  Imposed,"1st: 1306 Jun 24, 2nd: 1306 Dec 7, 3rd: 1307 May 8, 4th: 1307 Dec 1"
187,1297 Aug 20 ,clerical third or fifth on the clergy\'s temporalities ,Edward I ,"Immediately after his reconciliation with Archbishop Winchelsey the king renewed his demands for the grant of a clerical subsidy.  The archbishop summoned a convocation on 10 August 1297 to discuss the matter, and although the king had promised the redress of clerical grievances if the grant was made, the clergy would give its consent only if it was authorised by the pope, in accordance with the publication of his recent bull prohibiting the taxation of the clergy by secular rulers without papal sanction.  The king could not accept such a condition, and warned that, in his necessity, he would impose a tax on church goods on his own authority, but he softened the blow by giving the clergy a choice about the form of the levy.  On 20 August he issued instructions for the collection of a clerical fifth, to be levied according to the \'|Taxatio| of 1291\', or, if the clergy preferred, they could pay a third, levied on their temporalities alone.  Those with annual incomes of less than 5 marks were exempted from the levy.Since the fifth was to be paid on the existing valuation of 1291, and the third would have to be assessed, many of the clerks of both Canterbury and York province opted to pay the fifth.  Their payments, often made to the sheriffs, are recorded on the receipt rolls (E 401) for the last months of 1297 and for 1298.(|Parl.

In 1302, when funds were required for the Scottish war, parliament agreed that Edward I could now levy the tax, and on 7 November collectors were appointed.  The rate charged was £2 per knight\'s fee, half being due at the Purification, and half due at Ascension next following (2 February and 16 May 1303).Payment was intended to come from the sub-tenants, not the tenants-in-chief.  Because so many were remitted payment temporarily when the host assembled to fight in May, much of the money was late coming in.  Most of what was collected was spent on stores and equipment for the army in Scotland.  Sheriffs were ordered in October 1304 to account at the Exchequer, but collection dragged on into the next reign and at least one payment was still outstanding in 1340, for which a pardon was issued.In addition to the assessments returned to the Exchequer and now among the E 179 documents, the assessment of knights\' fees for the greater part of Norfolk is now BL Add MS 38, 513 (fos 5 onwards).(Chew, thesis, pp 160-162; |CPR 1301-1307|, p 76)enrolled account: E 359/5, rots 1-7; E 359/2, mm 5-17 ",Origin  Granted,"1st: 1303 Feb 2, 2nd: 1303 May 16"
449,1306 May 30 ,thirtieth and twentieth to knight the king\'s eldest son ,Edward I ,"In April 1306, the king announced his intention to knight his eldest son at the feast of Pentecost, and summoned a parliament to meet at Westminster on 30 May 1306 in order to grant him an aid for this purpose.  According to H.M. Chew, however, the real object behind his request for a grant of aid was to finance an expedition against Robert the Bruce, who laid claim to the throne of Scotland.  Instead of voting a separate tax for a Scottish campaign, parliament granted a general levy of a thirtieth on the counties, and a twentieth on all moveable goods in the cities and boroughs held on 29 September 1306, for both the knighting of the king\'s son and the impending war.  In exchange, the king undertook that the grant would not set a precedent to the prejudice of the lords and commons, nor become customary.  The temporalities of the clergy were also taxed.On 22 July 1306 commissioners to levy the aid were appointed by letters patent issued at Beverley, and they were instructed to collect the tax in three equal instalments, on 3 February, 28 May and 3 November 1307.  The threshold of liability was 10s (Willard, p. 88), and the goods exempt from the tax were the same as in 1290.  Different payment dates were specified, however, in commissions issued at Lanercost on 1 December 1306 for the assessment and collection of the thirtieth and twentieth in Tynedale and Hexhamshire.  The tax collected in those places did not have to be delivered to the Exchequer until 9 April, 28 May and 3 November in 1307.On 10 September 1306 writs of |supersedeas| were issued to sheriffs in those counties where the Knights Templar held lands, directing them to suspend the levy of the tax on the goods and villeins of the Templars until 13 October, by which time the master of the order was to have compounded with the king for a lump sum in lieu of the tax.(|Parl.

Archbishop Peckham summoned the Canterbury convocation to meet on 20 January and a fifteenth was eventually granted for three years.  It was to be levied according to the 1254 \'Valuation of Norwich\'.As in the north, the payments were to be made twice yearly on 24 June and 25 December, and the proceeds deposited in a safe place.  The archbishops were to certify the king of their collection, and he then ordered the tax money to be amassed in central treasuries; much of it was received by the keeper of the king\'s wardrobe.(Wilkins, |Concilia|, II, pp 40-41; Deighton, \'Clerical Taxation by Consent, 1279-1301\', pp 163-165) ",Origin  Granted,"1st: 1280 Jun 24, 2nd: 1280 Dec 25, 3rd: 1281 Jun 24, 4th: 1281 Dec 25, 5th: 1282 Jun 24, 6th: 1282 Dec 25"
690,c. 1280 Feb 5 ,clerical tenth from York province ,Edward I ,"Following the grant of a fifteenth from the clergy of Canterbury province in January 1380 towards the expenses of the Welsh war, the York convocation met in Pontefract around 5 February and granted a tenth for two years.  The grant excluded the diocese of Carlisle, which made its own grant, dating from 24 October.  The archdeaconry of Richmond was apparently likewise unrepresented at the convocation in Pontefract.As in the south, the tax was to be levied according to the 1254 \'Valuation of Norwich\'.  Indeed, the northern clergy made it a specific condition that the new assessment made in 1276 for the pope\'s sextennial tenth not be used, and the taxation of temporalities was to be excluded.  No royal officials were to be employed in the collection of the tax, only bishops or their deputies.  The payments were to be made twice yearly on 24 June and 25 December.  The proceeds were to be deposited in a safe place and the archbishops were to certify the king of its collection.  He then ordered the tax money to be amassed in central treasuries; much of it was received by the keeper of the king\'s wardrobe.(Wilkins, |Concilia|, II, pp 41-42; Deighton, \'Clerical Taxation by Consent, 1279-1301\', pp 163-165) ",Origin  Granted,"1st: 1280 Jun 24, 2nd: 1280 Dec 25, 3rd: 1281 Jun 24, 4th: 1281 Dec 25, 5th: 1282 Jun 24, 6th: 1282 Dec 25"
691,1297 Nov 29 ,clerical fifth from York province ,Edward I ,"On 23 October 1297 Henry of Newark, archbishop of York, issued a summons for a meeting of convocation at York on 29 November 1297.  Following the lead of the southern province, which had voted a tenth to the king on 20 November 1297, the York convocation granted a fifth.  The larger amount was given, no doubt, because of the province\'s more immediate interest in the Scots war, but with the provision that they were allowed to make their payments in kind in part, with some cathedral chapters required to provide horses.  It is possible that this tax replaced the earlier third or fifth in the same way that the lay ninth replaced the eighth and fifth.Both the higher and lower clergy had been represented in the Canterbury convocation, the latter by two proctors from each English diocese and one proctor from each Welsh diocese, and the grant that they made perhaps reflects this wider representation.  A tenth was granted, but whereas that paid by the archbishops, bishops, cathedral chapters and monasteries was to be levied according to the |Taxatio| of 1291, the tenth paid by the parish clergy was to be based upon the less severe 1254 \'Valuation of Norwich\'.  It seems likely that these same conditions applied in the northern province.The archbishop of Canterbury\'s writ for collection in the southern province, dated 4 December 1297, requested payment of the first half by 13 January and the second half by 16 March 1298; whether the payment dates in the north were the same is not known. Once the immediate crisis of the war with the Scots had passed, the clergy ceased to pay the subsidy.  When, in June 1298, Edward I asked for the balance of the tax to be paid, the Canterbury convocation replied that, now that the emergency had ended, no further payment could be made without papal permission.  Presumably the collection of the tax finished prematurely in the north as well, although a surviving schedule of arrears from the archdeaconry of Richmond (E 179/278/7) suggests that attempts to collect the tax continued.(Wilkins, |Concilia|, II, pp 230, 235-237; Deighton, \'Clerical Taxation By Consent, 1279-1301\', pp 188-191; R Graham, \'An Ecclesiastical Tenth for National Defence in 1298\', in her |English Ecclesiastical Studies| (London, 1929), pp 317-323) ",Origin  Granted,"1st: 1298 Jan 13 (?), 2nd: 1298 Mar 16 (?)"
25,1314 Nov 28 or earlier ,scutage ,Edward II ,"In April 1306 a feudal summons was issued to raise an army against Robert Bruce, which met with an inadequate response in the following July.  Fines were taken at the moderate rate of 20 marks per fee.  It is clear that the levy of scutage was contemplated from as early as April 1307, but the collection had not been undertaken by the death of Edward I.  It was left for his successor to impose the scutage due for the army of 1306, but the power struggle between Edward II and his barons prevented any attempt to raise the levy between 1307 and 1314.In June 1314, however, Edward II was forced to summon a feudal host to Berwick to march upon Stirling and relieve the English forces under siege there.  The disastrous Bannockburn campaign which ensued led to serious financial difficulties for the crown.  Upon the king\'s return from the North, then, a renewed effort was undertaken by the Exchequer to reimpose the double scutage of 1305, while a new levy was to be collected in connection with the army of 1306.  Collection by the sheriffs in the past had proved unsatisfactory, and therefore a new method of collection was devised.On 3 November 1314, a series of commissions was issued in which two or more taxers were appointed for each county to assess (by formal inquisition) and collect the double scutage of 1305, which was said to be, for the most part, \'unlevied\'.  The money gathered from this levy was to be delivered at the Exchequer in parcels as quickly as possible, and any tenants asking for acquittance, were to be given a day to prove their claim before the treasurers and barons of the Exchequer.  The same procedure was to be put in place for the levy of the 1306 scutage, and on 28 November 1314 commissions were issued to, in many cases, the same taxers.  For documents illustrative of the processes involved in the levy of all three of these scutages, see E 179/242/66.  In Wiltshire, the three scutages were still being levied in 1324. The lack of success in collecting both this and the earlier double scutage was due not only to the political upheavals of Edward II\'s reign, but to the still unresolved dispute between the Exchequer and the magnates over the numbers of fees for which scutage should be paid.  In addition, the Exchequer was suffering from overwork and a lack of cooperation among its officials.  Once again, opposition from the magnates caused the suspension of the collection and of the imposition of distraints in many cases, although small sums continued to trickle in to the Exchequer.  Some collectors were personally attacked and robbed. Although collection was nominally in process for over 25 years, it is probable that it was never completed and that the final accounting was never carried out.  Eventually, in return for a grant of direct taxation, Edward III abandoned attempts to collect these scutages in 1340, and pardoned all outstanding debts, including those for scutage, before 1336.(|Parl.

134,1307 Oct 13 x 16 ,twentieth and fifteenth ,Edward II ,"The first parliament of Edward II\'s reign was summoned to meet at Northampton on 13 October 1307.  Before that assembly adjourned on 16 October, the lords and commons granted a twentieth and fifteenth on moveables, ostensibly to meet the expenses of the burial of Edward I and the coronation of the new king, but in actual fact to finance the war with Scotland.On 28 November 1307 commissions were issued to two or more men in each county for the assessment and collection of the tax in two equal payments.  The tax was to be levied on all lay persons who held goods worth at least 10s. on 29 September 1307.  The commissioners were to be accompanied by a clerk, who was to compile a roll of the assessments in duplicate.  One of these rolls was to be delivered to the Exchequer on 25 March 1308, when the first payment of the tax was due.  The second payment was to be paid by 25 June 1308. In June 1308, the collectors were ordered to bring in by 8 July all the money that they had collected, under pain of a fine of £40, because of the king\'s urgent need for funds for the war in Scotland.  This tax was one of the matters which led to antagonism between Edward II and his barons, the barons later claiming that the receipts of this tax, and that of 1309, had been \'foolishly wasted\'.(Willard, |Parliamentary Taxes on Personal Property|, p 20; |CCR 1307-13|, p 41; |Parl.

135,1309 April 27 x May 13 ,twenty-fifth ,Edward II ,"Parliament assembled at Westminster on 27 April 1309, and before its adjournment on 13 May, the commons and the lay and ecclesiastical magnates granted a tax of a twenty-fifth on moveable goods in aid of the Scottish war, on condition that the king consented to eleven articles of reform.The actions of the king were postponed until the next meeting of parliament, and no commissions were issued for the time being to taxers and collectors.  The higher clergy and barons met at Stamford in July when the king agreed to deal with the recommended reforms.  On 26 August commissions were issued to the assessors and collectors who did not start work until several weeks later. They were instructed to make assessments on the basis of goods owned on 29 September 1309 with a threshold of 10s (Willard, p. 88), and pay the receipts into the Exchequer in two instalments.  Two copies of the assessment rolls were to be made, one of which was to be delivered to the Exchequer with the first payment on 14 January.  The second payment was due on 15 June 1310. On 10 December, because of complaints that the Stamford articles were not being observed, the king ordered the collectors to suspend collection between 29 December 1309 and 16 February 1310, but to proceed with the assessment and bring any money already received to the Exchequer by 29 December 1309. The prelates and lay magnates met again at Westminster on 8 February 1310, a meeting which resulted in the appointment of the Ordainers in the following month.  On 1 April orders were issued to the taxers and collectors to finish the assessment and to proceed with collection, the first payment date now being specified as 27 April 1310.It was later claimed by the barons that Edward had \'foolishly wasted\' the receipts from this tax.(|Parl.

Assessment rolls were to be made in two copies, one of which was to be returned to the Exchequer with the first payment on the morrow of the close of Easter (15 April 1314).  The second instalment was to be collected by the morrow of the Nativity of John the Baptist (25 June 1314).On 12 April 1314, however, the king sent a writ to all the collectors, asking that in view of the need to mobilise against Robert Bruce, they hurriedly collect both payments and bring them to the Exchequer; the collectors for Hertfordshire, Essex, Kent, Surrey, Sussex and Hampshire were asked to deliver the money by 17 May 1314, and those in all other counties except Northumberland, Cumberland and Westmoreland were allowed slightly longer, until 3 June. Despite this, on 6 June 1314 the Hampshire collectors were instructed to pay £200 to the keeper of Edward Earl of Chester\'s wardrobe, who was then at Ludgershall, Wiltshire: surviving receipts issued by the keeper for £150 are dated between 16 June 1314 and 9 September 1314 (E 179/377/7).(|CPR 1313-1317|, p 49; |Parl.

These specify that the first half of the tax was to be collected by the following quinzaine of Trinity (1 June), and the second half by the morrow of the feast of the Exaltation of the Cross (15 September).  Another copy of these instructions was sent to the commissioners for the levy of the fifteenth in Surrey; they list those items which were considerable non-taxable (E 179/184/3).Commissions appointing taxers for the levy of the fifteenth, enrolled on the Originalia Roll, were not issued until 10 May, and these specify a later date for the first payment of 24 June (E 379/75, m 30).

138,1316 Feb 20 - Aug 5 ,sixteenth and fifteenth ,Edward II ,"Parliament assembled at Lincoln on 27 January, and on 20 February, the last day of the session, the king unusually received two separate grants of taxation - one from the \'magnates and community of the realm\', and the other from the \'citizens, burgesses and knights of the counties\'.  An \'armed footman from every vill in the kingdom\' was granted by the magnates and commonalty, and the citizens, burgesses and knights of the counties voted a fifteenth to be levied in the cities, boroughs or royal demesne.Commissions for the assessment and collection of the fifteenth were issued on 8 June 1316, but no attempt was yet made to levy the tax, because reforms promised by the king in exchange for these grants and the selection of armed men had been delayed.On 25 June another parliament was summoned to meet at Lincoln on 29 July, and at this assembly, on or before 5 August, the lords and commons substituted a grant of a sixteenth for the earlier grant of foot soldiers.  Commissions for the assessment and collection of this sixteenth were issued on 5 August, significantly, on the same day that concessions made by the king concerning the forests were enacted.  The tax was to be paid in two halves - the first on 3 November 1316 and the second on 25 April 1317, with a threshold of 10s (Willard, p. 88).In early 1317, resistance to the tax was perceived.  Following a council held at Clarendon, writs were issued on 20 February to the collectors in each county instructing them to make returns identifying those who were impeding their work, and if necessary to receive assistance from the sheriff.  Only two returns to the enquiry are known to have survived.  That for Sussex stated that no resistance had been encountered in that county, while the return for Berkshire said the same but added that they would not be able to keep to their payment terms \'propter generalem inopiam communitatis comitatus predicti\' (C 47/8/3, nos 1-2, 25).

The twelfth was to be levied on moveable goods in cities and boroughs: on the assets of individuals \'in their houses or abroad, and upon the sea as well, whether in good debts, or in jewels of gold and silver or other property; goods arising from their foreign lands and tenements...only excepted\'.Assessors of the eighteenth were to be \'good men of the townships\' who had not previously served as tax assessors, because, as it was complained in parliament, \'in all the assessments of aids hitherto granted to the king, the assessors and under assessors and their clerks had embezzled a third or more of what had been levied from the people\'.  Despite these precautions, the officials responsible for collection in fourteen counties were later subjected to investigation after complaints were made. Appointment of the assessors and collectors was on 30 May 1319, but they were not given their instructions for assessment until 8 July 1319, on which date their appearance was ordered (via writs addressed to the sheriffs) before the council in the Exchequer under pain of £40 \'to receive the form of the taxation\'.

141,1318 Nov 22 or earlier ,tax levied in Wales ,Edward II ,"Like the tax levied in Wales in 1300, this levy was not granted in parliament, despite the fact that Natalie Fryde cites a memoranda roll entry noting an assignment \'out of the subsidy granted by the loyal Welshmen in Wales in the recent York Parliament\'. Even if the tax was not granted in Parliament, the money raised was clearly paid into the Exchequer and the enrolled account of the tax, for the collection of which Edmund Dynieton was responsible indicates that £939 12s 9 1/2d. was collected from Caernarfonshire, Anglesey and Merioneth.The order to levy the tax in North and South Wales appears among entries in the Fine rolls, dated 12 November 1318, in which the tax is described as a fifteenth, granted by the \'knights, good men and the whole commonalty\' on all their movable goods for the expedition of the war of Scotland.  This order includes the phrase \'as used to be done\', clearly showing that Edward II was taking the two previous levies collected in Wales as a precedent, despite Edward I\'s assurances to various areas concerned that they should not be seen as such.  An undated letter from the commonalty of South Wales, presumably written at some point after that date states that John Wawayn, the justice of Wales, came and asked for the grant, and that permission had been given by \'an old man, who without the assent of the whole community, thoughtlessly promised to give a fifteenth\'.  The letter requests that the community be allowed to pay the levy in livestock and crops, since its members were so poor that they had no money, but did not wish to break the promise given on their behalf.  The Exchequer account, however, suggests that this permission was not granted, but the circumstances described in the letter may explain why the sum raised was, accordingly to Natalie Fryde, \'comparatively\' small.  However, early in 1319, remission was granted elsewhere as the \'good men and commonalty\' of Dryslwyn and Newton and the \'knights, good men and commonalty\' of Cantref Mawr were spared their contribution towards the levy.Patent roll entries dated 22 and 23 November 1318 refer to aids granted \'by the knights and others\' in both North and South Wales, the receipts of which were to be paid over to Roger Mortimer of Wigmore and Roger Mortimer of Chirk.  Other information is, however, scarce, apart from an assignment to the latter of 1,600 marks out of the subsidy collected in North Wales and other issues of his bailiwick, which might suggest that the receipts from the levy were more than those shown in the account roll.  Entries in the Memoranda rolls of 1319-1320, seem to show that receipts from North Wales were in fact slightly less than those shown in the account roll; in these, Edward Dynieton accounted for £928 11s 1d; there may also have been problems in finalising the account, as it was not until 1327 that an allowance was made to him of £50 on his account for collecting the subsidy, for his expenses, as he claimed that there had been \'a great lack of victuals in those parts at that time\'.  At some point before that date, Dynieton had gone so far as to petition the king for another allowance, this time of £100 out of the proceeds of the subsidy, which Dynieton had delivered to Roger Mortimer of Chirk for Mortimer\'s expenses in \'going north with the king\' (TNA: PRO SC 8/108/5374).A fragment of an assessment for a fifteenth for places in Penllyn hundred, Merioneth has been located at E 101/506/15 mm 1 and 2.

167,1309 May 18 ,four papal tenths ,Edward II ,"On 1 August 1305, Pope Clement V had imposed upon the English clergy the levy of an annual tenth for the next seven years.  It was intended to be levied as three separate taxes: the first and second both of two years\' duration, and the third to continue for three years.  He granted the proceeds of six of those years to Edward I, and those of one of the years (the second) was promised to the then Prince Edward.  The first year of the tax was levied in 1306, and on 16 January 1307 the pope reserved a quarter of the revenue due to Edward I for the last four years of the tax to himself, to help pay expenses incurred by the papacy.  Edward I had received most of the proceeds of the first year of the tax before his death on 7 July 1307, and the pope subsequently granted what remained to be paid for the first biennial tax to Edward II.  The grant lapsed upon Edward I\'s death, and the second biennial tax was never levied.On 4 March 1309 Edward II despatched an embassy to Rome to seek the pope\'s acquiescence in a renewal of his grant of the third of the three taxes conceded to his father.  Not only did Clement V accede to this request, but he also granted an additional tenth for one year, to begin on 1 November 1312, when the triennial tenth would expire.  The pope\'s renewal was granted by a bull of 18 May 1309 addressed to the bishops of Lincoln and London, directing them to collect the triennial tenth in accordance with their mandate of August 1305.  They were instructed to pay three-quarters of the proceeds to Edward II and one-quarter to the papal legate.The two bishops appointed their deputies on 17 August.  According to the papal grant, the first instalment of the tax was due on 24 June 1310, but, like his father, Edward II interfered in the administration of the tax, and insisted upon the first payment on 2 November 1309.  The second instalment was to be paid on 13 January 1310.  The money was needed for the Scottish war and haste was urged by the king.  In many cases, therefore, the deputies collected the first payment in October and the second in December.  In response to royal pressure, the convocation of Canterbury met on 9 December 1310 and agreed to advance the payment date of the first instalment of the third year of the tax from 24 June to 13 January 1311.For the levy of the tax granted for an additional year the bishops of Lincoln and London were again appointed as collectors and bulls addressed to them on 30 May 1309 established the same mode of collection as had been employed for the triennial tenths, administered by the same deputy collectors.  It was considered a continuation of the triennial tenths, together with the first two tenths levied under Edward I, so that these taxes were often referred to by contemporaries collectively as the sextennial tenth.  The dates for payment of the final tenth were set at 24 June and 25 December 1313, but in practice the collection was anticipated by a few weeks.Exemptions from the tax were granted to bishoprics and monasteries which were in the king\'s hands by vacancy.  The Carthusian houses of Hinton and Witham were permanently exempted from papal income taxes levied on his behalf by Edward II, and the London Minoresses were excused from the levy of the first two tenths at the queen\'s request.  The nuns of Marrick Priory and the monks of Eglestone Abbey, who had suffered at the hands of the Scots, and the church of Llanfaes, burned during the Welsh war, were pardoned payment of all three tenths.  The tax was levied in accordance with the |Taxatio| of 1291.Most of the proceeds were paid into the Exchequer and the accounts of the collectors were enrolled there late in 1315.(|W E Lunt, \'Clerical Tenths Levied in England by Papal Authority During the Reign of Edward II\', |Anniversary Essays in Mediaeval History by Students of Charles Homer Haskins| (Boston and New York, 1929), pp 161-166; |CCR 1307-1313|, p 227; Lunt, |Financial Relations of the Papacy with England to 1327|, pp 384-395)Enrolled Accounts: E 359/3, rots 1-1d ",Origin  Imposed,"1st: 1309 Nov 2, 2nd: 1310 Jan 13, 3rd: 1310 Jun 24, 4th: 1310 Dec 25, 5th: 1311 Jan 13, 6th: 1312 Jun 24, 7th: 1313 Jun 24, 8th: 1313 Dec 25"

Despite their protestations about the illegality of the summons, they granted the king a tenth of their spiritual income for the defence of the church and the realm before parliament was dissolved on 9 March 1315.  The grant was made subject to a number of conditions, mostly concerning the redress of their grievances about violations of their ecclesiastical liberties.  The king promised to reply to their articles of grievance in the next session of parliament, but never did so.  The tax was, however, levied, although it provoked much critical comment from monastic chroniclers.Payment was to be made in two equal instalments, on 3 May and 14 September 1315.  Enrolled accounts of the collection of the tax are incomplete, but total gross receipts have been calculated by Ormrod at £16,200.(|Parl.

169,1314 June 26 ,clerical subsidy of 8-12d. per mark in York province ,Edward II ,"Urgently seeking a subsidy from the clergy, Edward II ordered the prelates and clergy of the southern province to meet at Westminster on 17 May 1314 and those of the northern province to assemble at York on 3 June 1314 to negotiate with the king\'s ministers about the grant of a tax on their income.  The clergy of York province do not appear to have responded to this summons, but only to a second summons from the archbishop.  They met on 26 June 1314, two days after defeat by the Scots at the battle of Bannockburn, and granted a subsidy of 12d. in the mark to the king.  In practice, it appears that other parts of the province paid variable amounts, from 8d.-12d. per mark.  The archdeaconry of Northumberland, for example, paid only 8d.  In the archdeaconry of Durham the full 12d. appears to have been levied.  In the southern province, no subsidy was paid, because the Canterbury convocation refused to make a grant.The subsidy was to be paid in two equal portions on 30 November 1314 and 11 May 1315.  Gross receipts of the tax are estimated by Ormrod at £2,300; this excludes the diocese of Carlisle, from which no enrolled account survives.(|Registrum Palatinum Dunelmense|, ed.

170,1312 April 3 ,six papal tenths ,Edward II ,"The council of Vienne was convened on 16 October 1311 at which a proposal to levy tenths to finance a new crusade was discussed.  The English representatives were among those who agreed to the plan, but it was not until a second session of the council assembled on 3 April 1312, after the approval of the French delegates, that Pope Clement V announced the imposition of a clerical tenth for six years.  Later that same month the pope granted the proceeds of the tenth to the lay rulers, reserving one-quarter of them for himself.  The papal bull imposing the tax was not issued until 1 December 1312, however, and the levy did not begin until the autumn of 1313.The first year was to be paid in equal instalments due on 1 October 1313 and 1 April 1314, and was to be levied in accordance with the |Taxatio| of 1291.  In a departure from the usual practice of appointing two principal collectors for England and Wales, each bishop was made a collector in his own diocese.  He was to pay the tenth on his own income and collect the tenth from all the other clergy of his diocese, apart from the Hospitallers and other military orders, who were exempt.  His deputies were to pay the proceeds and make an itemized account to him within ten days of the payment of each instalment, and he would in turn account to the pope.  The proceeds were to be held on deposit in his cathedral church upon further instructions.This more decentralized approach to the administration of the tax is probably partly to blame for a high rate of arrears in the collection of the first year\'s tax.  Soon after the second instalment of tax fell due, on 20 April 1314, Clement V died, and the collection of the remaining years of the tax was suspended, never to be resumed.Edward II had borrowed on the strength of the receipts and coerced the bishops into handing over the proceeds to him.  Although he promised to reimburse the pope, his promissory notes proved worthless.  In all, he realised about £18,500 from the collection of the tax.(W E Lunt, \'Clerical Tenths Levied in England by Papal Authority During the Reign of Edward II\', |Anniversary Essays in Mediaeval History by Students of Charles Homer Haskins| (Boston and New York, 1929), pp 166-169; Lunt, |Financial Relations of the Papacy with England to 1327|, pp 395-404)Enrolled Account: E 359/3, rots 2-2d?

171,1317 March 28 ,papal tenth ,Edward II ,"On 15 December 1316, Edward II sent an embassy to Pope John XXII with a request for financial aid, and on 28 March 1317 the newly-consecrated pontiff granted him a tenth of clerical income in England for one year.The bishops of Winchester and Exeter were commissioned to collect it, although the latter subsequently excused himself, and John Sandale, bishop of Winchester, administered the tax in both their names.The pope\'s bull did not specify which valuation was to be used as the basis for the levy.  In the southern province the |Taxatio| of 1291 was used, but in the province of York, it was levied according to a new valuation made on the king\'s orders, the so-called |Nova Taxatio|, which took account of the devastation of clerical property by the raids of the Scots (E 179/67/9, mm. 24, 27, 29, 35, 40). The re-valuation of the northern province reduced the yield of the tenth there from £4,125 to £2,872. This revised assessment continued to be employed for the collection of both clerical and papal taxes for the rest of the reign of Edward II. The first instalment of the tax was due on 1 June 1318 and the second on the following 1 October.The final account of the collectors was rendered at the Exchequer by the executors of the bishop of Winchester, who had died on 2 November 1319. The charge laid to the collectors was nearly £19,500, and they had arrears of over £2,740, which continued to trickle in until at least 1328.

One-quarter of the proceeds was to be reserved to the use of the papacy.The pope appointed the archbishop of Canterbury, the bishop of London and the bishop of Coventry and Lichfield as collectors.

Sheriffs were again made responsible for its collection, and the receipts of the levy were recorded on the pipe and receipt rolls, as was the case for all levies of tallages before that of 1303-4.No payment date was specified in the tallage writs, but the first payment was received at the Exchequer on 2 March 1313, and by Christmas receipts were less than £1,000.  The Berkshire collectors had evidently received some tallage money by 28 April 1313, when they were ordered to reimburse the expenses of Giles de Arpuche, keeper of the king\'s colts, out of \'the first receipts\'.  Although the levy yielded less than was received from the 1304 tallage, the collection of this tax was still reasonably successful, although slow to be completed; payments were still being received in May 1316. Estimated receipts of the tax in both the counties and the boroughs are printed by Hadwin. (J.F. Hadwin, \'The Last Royal Tallages\', pp 344-358; |CPR 1307-1313|, pp 520-521, 567) ",Origin  Imposed,
620,1319 May 28 ,scutage ,Edward II ,"Despite the grant of an eighteenth and twelfth in the same month, Edward II was still in need of money for his Scottish campaign.  Little headway was being made in the collection of earlier scutages because of baronial opposition and disagreement over the basis of the levy.  In addition, the magnates were demanding the right to levy scutage on their own rear vassals.  It was apparently decided that this latter concession would be made dependent on a further scutage, to be levied in connection with the Scottish campaign the king had mounted in 1310.  Most tenants-in-chief had avoided the summons for this altogether, and only seven had fined (at the rate of £40 per fee). On 28 May 1319, the treasurer and barons were directed to put this scutage in charge at the rate of two marks per fee (as with previous scutages, for all fees and not merely those for which the tenant acknowledged due service); in return, the magnates were to be allowed to levy scutage on their own tenants.  The collectors were instructed to hold local inquisitions into fees and to deliver their assessments into the Exchequer by 8 May 1320.This now meant that no less than six scutages (one of them double) were being collected simultaneously, without any final agreement having been reached over the terms of the levy, and while there was still vociferous local opposition.  The results were therefore unsatisfactory.  Sheriffs, bailiffs and jurors all refused to cooperate, and the collectors themselves were less than enthusiastic in imposing punishments.Following complaints in the parliament of October 1320, collection was suspended until Michaelmas 1321.  As in 1315, the magnates were offered this respite to allow them to furnish the same information about fees held as had been requested in 1315; once again, they did not respond, and in the autumn of 1321 the collection was resumed.  By 1335, however, few collectors had cleared their accounts.  Eventually, in 1340, when Edward III was faced with the refusal of parliament to grant a subsidy unless long-standing debts (including scutage) were pardoned, the attempt to collect all six scutages was finally abandoned, and debts incurred before 1336 were pardoned.

The clergy of the province of Canterbury were summoned to a synod in the church of the Augustinian abbey of St Mary de Pratis, Leicester, on 4 November 1327, at which they granted the tenth requested.  Like the province of York, they imposed the condition that the bishops had to be appointed as chief collectors, not the crown or its agents.  Accordingly, the king appointed the bishops as chief collectors on 28 November 1327. Payment of the tax was to be made in equal portions on 12 May and 1 November 1328.The gross yield of both provinces is estimated at £18,800.(W E Lunt, \'The Collectors of Clerical Subsidies\', in |English Government at Work 1327-1336|, ed.

142,1327 Sept 15 x 23 ,twentieth ,Edward III ,"Following his accession to the throne in January, the young Edward III was determined to continue the war with Scotland, and on 7 August 1327 summoned a parliament to meet at Lincoln on 15 September.  No records of the parliament survive, but the levy of a twentieth must have been decided on by 23 September, when commissions for its assessment and collection were issued.The threshold was to be 10s (Willard, p.88), but initial commissions do not cite any payment dates, but later commissions, issued on 5 and 12 October, reveal that the first instalment of the tax was due to be paid by 3 February 1328.  In London, however, the first payment was not due until 8 July 1328.Only the commission issued for the levy of the tax in London specifies a date for the second payment - 29 September 1328 - although the date may have applied generally.  The second payment would not appear to have been received at the Exchequer before 20 August 1328, because on that date the collectors in most counties were ordered to pay part of their receipts to the Bardi merchants, in order to settle the king\'s debts.The levy of the tax may have met with some resistance: the head collectors in Great Yarmouth were reportedly attacked. Note a writ at E 179/242/63, rot 12, sch 1, requesting a copy of the assessment for Great and Little Ponton and Stroxton, Winnibriggs wapentake, Lincolnshire, dated 1 December 1338, and the requested duplicate at rot 12: perhaps proceedings were still being followed against defaulters more than ten years later.(|Foedera|, IV, p 301; |CPR 1327-1330|, pp 172-173, 286; |CCR 1327-1330|, pp 311-312); Willard, |Parliamentary Taxes on Personal Property|.enrolled account: E 359/8A, rot 1; E 359/14, rots 16-17 ",Origin  Granted,"1st: 1328 Feb 3, 2nd: 1328 July 8, 3rd: 1328 Sept 29"
143,1332 Sept 9 x 12 ,fifteenth and tenth ,Edward III ,"On 25 June 1332 Edward III issued writs ordering the imposition of a tallage.  Like the last such levy, this tax was to be a two-tiered imposition - a ninth on lands and a fourteenth on moveable goods.  The instructions issued for the levy were similar to those of 1312, but such a levy was evidently deemed unacceptable in the parliament which met at Westminster on 9 September, and the king was offered a subsidy of a fifteenth and tenth in its place before that assembly adjourned on 12 September.  The king accepted this offer, after statements about troubles in Ireland and the prospect of difficulties with Scotland had been set before the assembly.  According to Hadwin, by agreeing to the substitution Edward \'gained a subsidy worth £34,000 instead of the £5,000 or so he might have raised by a tallage\'.Two assessors and collectors were appointed for each county on 16 September 1332.  They were in turn to appoint under-assessors who would make the assessment, receive the money and transfer it to the principal assessors and collectors; these persons were responsible for paying the money into the Exchequer. Materials from the East Riding of Yorkshire demonstrate that the assessments were to be made on goods held at Michaelmas (29 September) 1332 (see e.g. E 179/202/15, 25; the survival of such materials from the East Riding may be related to the investigation of the activities of the collector there, one Thomas de Boulton: see Willard, J.F., |Parliamentary Taxes on Personal Property 1290-1334| (1934), 215, 224-6, and cf. E 179/202/20). As before, duplicate rolls of assessment were to be prepared, one of which was to be returned to the Exchequer.  This assessment proved to be the basis of the fifteenth and tenth granted in 1334, and for all those to follow, as was this two-tiered system for assessment and collection.A writ to the Northumberland assessors sanctioning a delay in the making of the assessment for that county because of the frequent attacks of the Scots, reveals the dates on which the assessment and payment were due at the Exchequer for all other counties. The first instalment was due on 3 February 1333 and the second on 31 May 1333. These dates are confirmed by the writ appointing the Abbot of St. Mary\'s, York, as receiver for the northern counties on 27 January 1333 (|CFR 1330-34|, p.395).There were numerous and persistent allegations of corruption among the collectors, but it was not until July 1335, almost three years after the tax was granted, that commissions of enquiry were appointed in groups of counties, with instructions to investigate these charges secretly.Many county assessments made for the levy of this fifteenth and tenth have been printed.  For references to these, see Glasscock, |The Lay Subsidy of 1334|.  The total amount assessed for the subsidy was £34,295 17s. 2 1/2d.(|Rot.

144,1334 Sept 19 x 23 ,fifteenth and tenth ,Edward III ,"Parliament assembled at Westminster on 19 September 1334, and before its dismissal on 23 September, it granted a fifteenth and tenth for the defence of the realm against the Scots and \'other great matters\'.  The tax was payable in two instalments, on 7 December 1334 and 16 February 1335.  Because of the depredations of the Scots, the inhabitants of Northumberland were excused payment.With this levy one phase in the evolution of taxation of personal property ends.  Complaints at the way in which the 1332 tax had been handled led to a change in the method of assessment.  Commissions issued to the taxers and collectors on 4 October placed two men for each county - one a royal official, the other an ecclesiastic (usually an abbot or prior) - in charge of the assessment and instructed them to levy not less than the amount levied in 1332.  On the same day they were also commissioned to treat with the commonalty of the cities and boroughs, and men of the vills and ancient demesne, and settle with them an overall amount which they should pay.  If negotiations failed, the taxers were to assess the amount themselves.  When the amounts due from the various local districts were determined, the two chief taxers were to record them upon an indenture, one part of which was to be sent to the Exchequer, and the other was to be kept by the chief assessor, the abbot or prior, for the purpose of collecting the subsidy. Whereas the rolls of the 1332 tax contain names of taxpayers of the townships and boroughs, and a statement of the sums each person was to pay, the rolls of the 1334 tax contain simply the names of the townships and boroughs, and the total sums for which they were responsible.  The sums agreed became the basis of a standardised fifteenth and tenth that, while granted periodically as extraordinary taxation, continued to be levied for 300 years.  In 1332, however, London negotiated a fine of 1,100 marks in lieu of paying the fifteenth. This new assessment increased the overall yield, and the quota system as a whole had other advantages as well.  As G.L. Harriss has pointed out, \'any further tendency of the lay subsidy to shrink was counteracted by stabilising the quota for each county and each vill at a slightly higher figure than the preceding tax of 1332.  This avoided delay in negotiating and collecting the tax, and was a further step towards familiarising the realm with the need for recurrent taxation.  It may also have helped to shift the burden rather more onto the shoulders of the peasantry.\'  Fixing the amounts had the added benefit that theft by the collectors was more easily detectable. The quotas allocated to each township and borough are printed in Glasscock, |The Lay Subsidy of 1334|, 1975.A document relating to this tax grant for the hundred of Tandridge, Surrey is in Surrey History Centre (2575/fol 1).(|CPR 1334-1338|, pp 38-40, 114; |CFR 1327-1337|, p 467; Harriss, |King, Parliament and Public Finance|, p 85; D.

145,1336 March 11 x 20 ,fifteenth and tenth ,Edward III ,"Parliament assembled at Westminster on 11 March 1336 and before adjourning on 20 March, granted a fifteenth and tenth.  Commissions were issued on 7 April to groups of men in the different counties.  The writs made no mention of assessment but ordered the commissioners to receive from the cities, boroughs and vills the same sums paid for the fifteenth and tenth levied in 1334.  To aid the collectors, schedules of the amounts paid in that year were handed over when they took the oath, although the apportionment in each district was left to the discretion of the local people.  The tax was payable in two equal instalments on 1 July 1336 and 22 September 1336. From this point on, parliament based the grant of a fifteenth and tenth on the previous grant of a fifteenth and tenth, the ultimate foundation of all such taxes being the charge upon taxpayers in 1334.  The fifteenth and tenth became, therefore, a fixed sum of money as paid in 1334, no more nor less.  Some flexibility permitted lowering of assessments for towns suffering poverty but there was no increase for greater prosperity (see, however, E 179/173/33).  On occasions when poverty was pleaded, orders were issued for individual assessments to be made.  A few towns in Cambridgeshire, for example, were assessed, since they claimed to have lost much of their harvest of corn in a sudden hailstorm, and the first payment of their tax was postponed until 2 August.  Similarly, detailed instructions for assessment were issued to the collectors in Northumberland, Westmorland and Cumberland, presumably because the continuing depredations caused by the war made it difficult to levy regular amounts.  These collectors were told that there was a threshold of liability for the tax of 10s. (and 6s. within the royal demesne).The collection of this tax was not, however, altogether straightforward.  The Cambridgeshire tax collectors were later assaulted, as were those of Lincolnshire, while in Essex the subcollectors refused to hand over the money that they had collected.  Bristol made fine not to pay.

178,1327 Oct 13 ,clerical tenth from York province ,Edward III ,"Parliament was convened at Lincoln on 15 September 1327, and the clergy was asked to grant Edward III a subsidy of a tenth of the income from their spiritualities and temporalities.  Both provinces insisted upon consulting the clergy of the province in convocation before agreeing to the grant.  The archbishop of York summoned a provincial council on 12 October, and on the following day he announced that a tenth had been voted for the defence of the church and the realm, subject to several conditions.The grant would be cancelled, for example, in the event that a papal levy was imposed on the clergy, on the king\'s behalf.  Any property which had been destroyed by the Scots was to be re-assessed, to take account of the decline in value.In accordance with these provisos, the king ordered the archbishop of York to appoint assessors of clerical income in the archdeaconries of Cleveland and East Riding on 14 November, and on 22 December, this mandate was extended to cover the whole of York diocese (E 179/67/9, mm. 2, 5-6, 17, 20-23). This order was the result of a number of petitions to the king and council from monastic houses and incumbents of destroyed churches - for example, that from the priors of Guisborough, Newburgh, Kirkham, Malton and Marton (now SC 8/115/5713), some of which are cited in writs ordering the re-assessment (E 179/67/9, mm. 1, 7-16).A third condition was that the bishops were to appoint the sub-collectors, not the crown or its agents.  Accordingly, the king appointed the bishops as chief collectors on 28 November 1327.The work of the assessors took place in December 1327 and January and February 1328 and their assessments are gathered together in one file, some of which give details of the destruction caused (E 179/67/9, mm. 17-18, 20-23). This re-assessment was the basis for the levy of all clerical tenths in the province after 1327.Payment of the tax was to be made in equal portions on 2 February and 24 June 1328.The gross yield of both provinces is estimated at £18,800.(W E Lunt, \'The Collectors of Clerical Subsidies\', in |English Government at Work 1327-1336|, ed.

179,1330 Jan 3 ,four papal tenths ,Edward III ,"In the latter part of 1329, the ambassadors of Edward III treated with Pope John XXII to impose a tax on the clergy in England, the proceeds of which were to be shared between king and pope.  As a result of their representations, on 3 January 1330, the pope ordered the clergy of England to pay a tax of one-tenth of the income from its spiritualities and temporalities for four years.  Mandates were sent to the archbishops of Canterbury and York, commanding them to collect the tenths in their respective dioceses, beginning the next Easter.  Half of the proceeds were to be granted to Edward III to help him pay heavy debts which he had accrued due to disturbances and wars at the beginning of his reign.  His empty treasury, it was said, prevented him from protecting the church and the clergy of the kingdom against injuries.  Equally, the pope\'s need to repel the attacks of Italian heretics and schismatics placed him in a similar financial position, and he determined, therefore, that the proceeds of the tax were to be divided between him and Edward III.The tax was to be paid by all clergy, except for the master and brothers of the order of St. John of Jerusalem, and it was to be levied according to the assessment used previously.  One-half was to be paid on 24 June and the other half on 11 November in each of the next four years, although when the transmission of the pope\'s letter of 3 January was delayed until 19 July, the payment of the first instalment was allowed to be postponed to 29 September 1330.Collectors could enforce payment by the use of ecclesiastical censures and the sequestration of the fruits of benefices.  Defaulters and contumacious clergy could be cited to appear before the pope and the aid of the secular arm invoked to assist collectors.  Sub-collectors were to be appointed to collect the tax, render account for it and, usually within 6-8 days, deliver the proceeds to the collectors, who were, in turn, to assign the receipts after each instalment to a receiver named by the pope.  The sub-collectors were allowed to retain parts of the sums which they had collected in reimbursement of their expenses.After his experiences with Edward II, Pope John XXII was clearly intent on retaining control over the collection process himself and he procured a promise from Edward III that the collectors would not be disturbed by royal officials unless called upon by the collectors for assistance.  Despite this agreement, however, the king interfered in the administration of the collection of the tax on several occasions.  By a writ of 13 September 1330, for example, Edward III ordered the pope\'s receiver, Itier de Concoreto, not to levy the tenth on benefices worth less than 6 marks annually, unless the incumbent held other benefices.  It had become the usual practice to exempt such benefices, he claimed, and the pope had ordered that the tax was to be levied in the customary manner.  The king also demanded other exemptions for certain of his subjects, such as the master and brothers of the order of St. Lazarus of Jerusalem, and the nuns of Heynings Priory - the latter on the grounds of their poverty.  In other cases, taxpayers petitioned the king for exemptions and relief, and their claims were examined by the Exchequer.The king also facilitated the use of the |Novo Taxatio| as the basis of the assessment of the dioceses of Carlisle and Durham, and the parts of the diocese of York where the new assessment had been made in 1318 and subsequent years.  He ordered the papal receiver not to exact the tenth beyond the new rate of valuation, and those who were taxed under the old (higher) valuation were to be reimbursed for the excess.Arrears of the tax continued to be chased for decades after the period of its levy, but by 1339 the king probably received all but a few hundred pounds of the nearly £35,600 due to him for his half of the four tenths.These four tenths were the last of the series of tenths imposed upon the English clergy by papal mandate of which the kings of England received a portion or the whole of the proceeds.  Thereafter, beginning in 1336, with the onset of the French wars, Edward III was able to persuade the clergy to make regular grants of taxation to him.(Lunt, |Financial Relations of the Papacy with England 1327-1534|, pp 75-88) ",Origin  Imposed,"1st: 1330 Sep 29, 2nd: 1330 Nov 11, 3rd: 1331 Jun 24, 4th: 1331 Nov 11, 5th: 1332 Jun 24, 6th: 1332 Nov 11, 7th: 1333 Jun 24, 8th: 1333 Nov 11"

It was not until 19 September 1334 that the clergy of the southern province met at St Paul\'s to discuss this request and granted him a tenth of the income from their spiritualities and temporalities.The king\'s writ to each bishop, ordering the appointment of deputies and the collection of the tax was dated 24 October 1334.

Later in the year, on 30 September, a another meeting of the province was convoked at Leicester to debate a request for further financial assistance to the king.  This assembly voted him a second subsidy of a tenth, which was to be collected after that of the first had been completed.  The tax was thus levied as one subsidy of two tenths, to be collected in four instalments: on 2 February and 24 June 1337, and on 2 February and 24 June 1338.A condition attached to the grants made by both provinces was that the imposition on the English clergy of six tenths by Pope John XXII be revoked, since royal and papal tenths were not to be levied concurrently.  Anything collected by papal agents was to be offset against the two tenths which the clergy had granted to the king.  In the event, the papal tenths were revoked.Gross receipts for each tenth in both provinces were about £19,000.(|CFR 1337-1347|, pp 16-17; |CCR 1337-1339|, pp 79-81; W E Lunt, \'The Collectors of Clerical Subsidies\', in |English Government at Work 1327-1336|, ed.

They proceeded to grant the king a subsidy of three tenths, to be paid in successive years, just as the laity had done.Commissions to the collectors were issued on 25 October 1337.  Payment was to be made in two instalments in each of the three years: on 2 February and 24 June.  Following the agreement of convocation on 1 October 1338, the king ordered that the payment of the tenth of the second year be brought forward to 30 November 1338 and 25 March 1339.  The payment dates for the third year remained as originally prescribed, on 2 February and 24 June 1340.Gross receipts of the tax from both provinces was about £19,000 per annum.(Wilkins, |Concilia|, II, pp 622-623; |CFR 1337-1347|, pp 57, 98-99; Weske, |Convocation of the Clergy|, p 249; W M Ormrod, \'The Crown and the English Economy, 1290-1348\', |Before the Black Death : Studies in the \'Crisis\' of the Early Fourteenth Century|, ed.

184,1337 Sept 26 x Oct 4 ,three fifteenths and tenths ,Edward III ,"Edward III envisaged a swift and successful campaign to settle his claim to the French crown, even though he was still at war with Scotland.  He therefore needed access to enormous sums of money, especially as he was heavily in debt.  G.L. Harriss estimates that by the end of 1337 the king owed c.£124,000 to his most important allies, and had to raise another quarter of a million pounds by the spring of 1338.Before summoning a parliament, he embarked on an intensive propaganda campaign intended to produce a favourable frame of mind in his subjects, and to assist him in levying the special subsidy already granted to him in July 1337.  The success of this campaign, and probably the hope that a large grant would bring the war to a quick and successful conclusion, is attested by the grant of three entire fifteenths and tenths. This unprecedented grant of three fifteenths and tenths was voted in the assembly which convened at Westminster on 26 September 1337 and sat until 4 October, and was to be collected over three years.  The tax was payable in six equal instalments, on 1 December and 2 February annually, although London had to pay the first whole fifteenth in one lump sum by 12 April 1338, since there had been a delay in issuing the commission for collection there until 8 March 1338.  In all other counties, the collectors had been appointed on 6 or 8 October 1337. Once again, individual towns suffering hardship, for reasons of |force majeure| or because of damage inflicted by war, were subject to individual assessment.  Even so, some communities were reluctant to pay - Newcastle upon Tyne, for example - and the Isle of Wight pleaded the cost of its own defences in a bid to avoid payment.The king sailed for the Brabant in July 1338, but the failure of his financial arrangements, particularly the simultaneous wool tax, followed swiftly.  Prices collapsed and Edward\'s debts increased.  Many towns were asked for anticipations of the second and third years\' payments, but even when they agreed many did not (and perhaps could not) fulfil their promises.  The usual complaints of corruption, and of collectors refusing to hand over what they had collected, were heard. By August 1338 the king was complaining of the failure of the Exchequer to forward the revenue due to him from either this levy or the wool tax, while public mistrust grew because of his need to assign what he did receive to his creditors.  This led to the suspicion that those financiers were mismanaging and embezzling his funds.  While the council tried to deflect Edward\'s anger by explaining that there were internal defence expenses to be met - garrisons, fleets, victualling the armies in Scotland, etc. - the king became ever more suspicious of the loyalty and honesty of his council.  Discontent in the localities grew even more noticeable because of the large scale purveyance in central and southern England (areas hitherto little affected by this practice), and public opinion turned against the whole French expedition.

185,1344 June 26 ,two fifteenths and tenths ,Edward III ,"Parliament opened on 7 June 1344, but it was not until 26 June that it granted two fifteenths and tenths, payable in four equal instalments over two years.  The grant of the second fifteenth and tenth was conditional upon the king\'s departure for France to continue the war. The money, once collected, was to be placed in local churches and monasteries for safekeeping.The first fifteenth and tenth was due to be paid on 2 November 1344 and 27 March 1345. Commissions for collection of both payments of this fifteenth and tenth were issued on 1 October 1344, and the collectors were instructed where they were to deposit the receipts of the tax.Payment of the second fifteenth and tenth was due on 2 November 1345 and 16 April 1346, and commissions for collection of both payments were issued on 2 August 1345, again directing the collectors where to deposit the money.Although the truce with France was in force when the first payment was due, Edward III had already borrowed £5,000 from the customs farmers against this tax in October 1344, and later made assignments on it to repay loans from the Italian bankers known as the Bardi.  Hostilities broke out again in 1345, and the king used the tax as security for further military expenses in 1346-1347 (the Crecy campaign). The commons insisted that tax money collected north of the Trent should be set aside for the defence of the north, to which the king consented, and surviving warrants suggest that this revenue was reserved for this purpose.  John Wodehouse was appointed receiver north of the Trent, and rendered his account for both receipts and disbursements at the Exchequer in January 1347.(|Rot.

186,1346 Sept 14 ,two fifteenths and tenths ,Edward III ,"Parliament opened on 11 September 1346 and on 14 September granted two fifteenths and tenths to be collected in four equal payments over two years.  Like the last grant of fifteenths and tenths, the second was to be collected only if the war continued. Payment of the first fifteenth and tenth was due on 1 November 1346 and 1 April 1347, and commissions were issued to the collectors of both payments on 5 October 1346.  The second fifteenth and tenth was due to be paid on 1 November 1347 and 19 April 1348, and commissions were issued to the collectors of both instalments on 25 August 1347.Once again the commons wanted the tax money collected north of the Trent to be reserved for the defence of the north.  This was reluctantly agreed and once again John Wodehouse, who had acted as receiver in the north for the fifteenths and tenths granted in 1344, was appointed as receiver. The collection of the second year\'s payments was contentious.  After Edward III captured Calais a truce was agreed in September 1347, which led to such general expectations that no further taxation would be needed that Edward had to scotch rumours that the collection of the wool tax had been suspended.  According to Dr. Harriss, the king also insisted on the collection of the second fifteenth and tenth, doubtless because assignments had been made on it to pay his debts.  The collectors of the fifteenth and tenth encountered considerable opposition and some refusals to pay.  The resentment may have been further fuelled by the fact that the parliament in which the tax was granted was of only nine days\' duration (adjourning on 20 September), allowing little time for petitions of grievance, and the aid to knight the Black Prince may even have been granted by the lords alone after the commons had dispersed.(|Rot.

395,1348 March 31 x April 13 ,three fifteenths and tenths ,Edward III ,"Parliament opened on 31 March 1348 and before adjourning on 13 April granted the king three fifteenths and tenths, each of which was to be collected in two equal bi-annual instalments, over three years.  The grant was made, at least in part, in return for Edward III\'s agreement to suspend the collection of the aid to knight his eldest son Edward.  Certain conditions were attached to the grant, reflecting the commons\' frustration with the sustained high levels of taxation over this period.The final year\'s payment was only to be collected if no truce was concluded; the money was to be used for the war and not to repay old debts; the tax was not to be converted into a wool levy; the king was not to raise loans from the taxpayers in advance of the due payment dates; and the revenue north of the Trent was to be set aside for the defence of the north, if war with the Scots broke out again.  For the third time, John Wodehouse was appointed receiver for the north, but only for the first year\'s payments, after which the tax receipts were all to be received at the Exchequer.Payment of the first fifteenth and tenth was due on 29 September 1348 and 11 April 1349, and commissions for collection of both payments of the first fifteenth and tenth were issued on 20 July 1348.  The second fifteenth and tenth was to be paid by 29 September 1349 and 27 March 1350, and commissions for collection of both payments were issued on 16 July 1349.  The third fifteenth and tenth was due at the Exchequer on 29 September 1350 and 17 April 1351, and collectors were appointed to collect both payments on 20 July 1350.In 1349 and 1350, there was widespread resistance to the levy because of the dislocation caused by the Black Death.  Despite intermittent truces, Edward proceeded with the collection of the final year\'s payments.With the onset of the Black Death, those more affluent township residents who were normally responsible for payment of the tax complained that, despite the passage of the Ordinance of Labourers, they still found themselves forced to pay excessive wages to labourers and workmen, so that they were unable to pay their tax in full.  Instructions were therefore issued that collectors should retrospectively assess the excessive wages such individuals had received and force them to pay towards the second fifteenth and tenth.  This proved impractical, since most of the labourers had already spent the money they had received (or claimed that they had), so amended orders were issued for the collection of both the second and third fifteenths and tenths.  Instead of imprisoning these labourers, which would only impoverish them further and deprive those who employed them of their services, the collectors were instructed to use \'other (undefined) means\' to force them to pay, or take security from them that in future they would not demand or accept wages in excess of those laid down in the ordinance.These instructions are calendared from the instructions enrolled on the patent and fine rolls, which had been issued to the collectors in Hampshire, Essex and Suffolk for the second fifteenth and tenth, and in Essex, Middlesex and Somerset for the third fifteenth and tenth, but they were probably issued to the collectors in all counties.  In Kent, certainly, where the exemptions from taxation of the Cinque Port barons and the workers of the Canterbury mint meant that individual assessments were still made for the levy of fifteenths and tenths, \'workmen and labourers\' were listed separately in many hundreds (see, for example, E 179/123/23).(|CFR 1347-1356|, pp 90-92, 190-198, 220-221, 265-266, 268-273; |CPR 1348-1350|, pp 456-457; Harriss, |King, Parliament and Public Finance|, pp 320-322, 336-337, 351-353)enrolled account: E 359/10, rots 6-10; E 359/14, rots 38-42 ",Origin  Granted,"1st: 1348 Sept 29, 2nd: 1349 April 11, 3rd: 1349 Sept 29, 4th: 1350 March 27, 5th: 1350 Sept 29, 6th: 1351 April 17"
396,1346 Sept 14 x Nov 1 ,aid to knight the king\'s son Edward ,Edward III ,"Edward knighted his eldest son Edward (later the Black Prince) in Normandy at the start of the Crecy campaign.  The magnates present were \'persuaded to consent to the levy\' of an aid and wrote to parliament on 8 September 1346, asking for confirmation of the grant.Parliament assembled on 11 September 1346 and agreed to grant the aid, at the rate of 40s. per knight\'s fee throughout the realm.  The letter from the council in Calais was read to the lords at the end of the parliament, but not until after the commons had granted two fifteenths and tenths on 14 September, and perhaps not until after the latter had dispersed on 20 September.  This tactic was undoubtedly partly responsible for the unpopularity of the aid, since this underhand way of procuring the grant had deprived the commons of the opportunity of a bargaining counter for petitions of grievance.Commissioners, consisting of two knights and the sheriff of each county, were issued with writs for assessment and collection of the aid on 1 November 1346, and the tax was payable by the quinzaine of Hilary (27 January 1347).  The commissioners were to collect \'from all knights\' fees held as well as of the king as of others\'.  They were to compile their lists of fees from copies of the records of the aid levied in 1302 to marry Edward I\'s daughter, supplemented by inquests taken by local jury.In July 1346, orders were sent out to the men of Cheshire to make a similar grant, supposedly \'the first outright grant of taxation by the men of Cheshire to their lord since the fifteenth of 1292\' (Booth, p 119).  At the same time, the community of Flintshire was also requested by the Prince of Wales to grant him a similar aid towards the expenses he would incur during his forthcoming expedition to France.  This may be an attempt to widen the scope of revenue raising in time of need, to areas not normally included in taxation, to coincide with non-Parliamentary grants levied on the rest of the country.There is no question but that the levy was much resented.  Responses ranged from refusals to serve as jurors on inquisitions of assessment, to open violence when attempts to levy the aid by distraint were made, and some commissioners were reluctant to execute their commissions.  In April 1347, the prince\'s officials in Cheshire complained that none of the grant had been collected. By May 1347 pressure was being exerted on the collectors to bring in their receipts, and in the north, where money was needed \'at a critical juncture in the northern war\', little or nothing had been collected by July 1347.The parliament which assembled on 31 March 1348 complained that the king was levying an aid which was contrary to statute law on two grounds.  The first was that the levy of all aids had been pardoned in 1340 and the second, that the rate of 40s. per knight\'s fee breached the Statute of Westminster of 1281, which established that only 20s. per knight\'s fee could be levied as a reasonable aid.  On neither ground was their objection to the aid entirely tenable, but collection was suspended after the commons agreed to grant the king three fifteenths and tenths, although, by that time, much of the aid had already been collected.  The matter was not formally settled, however, until 1352, when the king agreed that any future aids would be levied at no more than 20s. per knight\'s fee, and 20s. per £20 worth of land held in socage, and these rates were fixed by statute (25 Edw. III, Stat 5, c 11).  Arrears of the tax were still being collected in the north, however, in May 1355.  The total net receipts of the tax were £9,003.8s.10d. Many of the returns are printed in |Feudal Aids|.  A copy of the assessments made for the levy of this tax, together with the assessments for the next levy of a feudal aid (that of 1401-2 to marry Henry IV\'s daughter), was compiled, copied, lavishly decorated with gold leaf, and bound into a book, probably for Henry V, and is now among the miscellaneous books of the King\'s Remembrancer, at E 164/3.(|Rot.

397,1352 Jan 21 x 22 ,three fifteenths and tenths ,Edward III ,"Parliament opened on 13 January 1352.  The king asked for a grant specifically to defend Gascony and Brittany, and to safeguard the sea, even though a truce with Castile was in force - continuing his tendency to levy taxes even in times of truce by invoking the threat of France\'s intentions to resume the war.  Although the commons made it clear that they were reluctant to agree to further taxation, since continual taxation and the effects of the Black Death had impoverished the kingdom, on either 21 or 22 January they granted three fifteenths and tenths over three years, each of which was to be paid in two equal instalments, before presenting their grievances.  A condition of the grant was that the third fifteenth and tenth would be collected only if the war was still being waged.  The commons also asked that no other aid should be demanded in addition to the tax that they had granted, and that in view of the \'moult grande et outrageouse charge\', even those normally exempt from taxation should contribute to the tax.  The king and his council would not, however, consent to either request. The first fifteenth and tenth was due to be paid on 8 April and 29 September 1352, and commissions for the collection of both payments were issued on 25 February 1352.  The second fifteenth and tenth was payable on 24 March and 29 September 1353, for which commissions for collection were issued on 26 January 1353.  The third fifteenth and tenth was due to be paid on 13 April and 29 September 1354, and commissions for collection were issued on 26 January 1354.Fines collected for violations of the Ordinance and Statute of Labourers were to be distributed among \'needy townships and hamlets\' of each county to assist in payment of the tax.  Before the apportionment of the fines occurred, however, the sums due to the justices for their daily wages for sitting to enforce the statute were subtracted.  It was the responsibility of the collectors to pay these wages to the justices, and the receipts given to them by the justices were submitted when they rendered their account at the Exchequer.  The apportionment to the indigent townships was to be made by the collectors and 25-30 elected representatives from the county, with the advice of the justices. The tax was extremely unpopular: assaults and robberies are known to have been perpetrated against the collectors in Hampshire and Westmorland, for example, while in Leicestershire a deputy collector was murdered.At the great council in 1353, the commons asked that the tax money levied should be set aside for war expenditure, even though large sums had already been assigned for the king\'s household, since most of his earlier debts had by now been discharged or substantially reduced.(|Rot.

398,1357 April 17 x May 5 ,fifteenth and tenth ,Edward III ,"Parliament opened on 17 April 1357 and, before its adjournment on 16 May, granted one fifteenth and tenth, to be paid in two equal instalments on 29 September 1357 and 1 April 1358.  No record of the parliament survives, but the grant must have been made before 5 May, when it was mentioned in a writ (referred to below) to the keepers of the peace.In return for this grant the king pardoned the commons from all the fines payable for the escapes of thieves and felons and the chattels of felons and fugitives which were due in respect of the period before the grant was made, and which had not yet been adjudged before the justices or put in estreats;  they were also released from all communal amercements payable to the king which had not yet been assessed.  (The escapes of convicted clerics from the prisons of their ordinaries were excepted from this pardon.)  The escapes, and any chattels which remained in the hands of the king\'s ministers, were to be adjudged by presentment before the keepers of the peace in each county and the results delivered in an indented estreat to the collectors of the tax, so that the proceeds might be distributed by the collectors among the needy townships to offset their assessments.  Letters were issued to the keepers of the peace on 5 May, instructing them to begin this process, and the commissions to the collectors were dated 1 August.The justices, however, failed to carry out their duties in this matter and as a result letters were issued between 3 December 1357 and 16 January 1359 directing the collectors to hold inquisitions concerning the escapes and chattels themselves.  They were to enrol the results, collect the money which would normally be due to the king, and distribute it among the poorer townships by indenture.  Many of these indented receipts survive in the class E 179.  For example, there are three surviving receipts for Rutland, dated between 30 September and 1 October 1358 (E 179/165/24), and twenty-seven for Lincolnshire, dated on 10 or 24 September in the same year (E 179/135/62).  As a result of the special circumstances of this tax, the collectors usually presented two sets of particulars at the Exchequer, one containing the customary schedule of payments towards the fifteenth and tenth, and the other containing the details of the fines collected and of their distribution.In addition to the numerous such documents in E 179, the records of a large number of inquisitions held to establish the value of the goods of various felons and fugitives in connection with this tax, particularly for Northamptonshire and Lincolnshire, can be found within a file of general inquisitions into forfeited goods now at E 163/3/1.

399,1360 March 9 x April 13 ,fifteenth and tenth ,Edward III ,"In the emergency situation brought about by the imminent invasion of England by France, parliament could not be assembled.  The extraordinary measure was therefore taken of empowering local assemblies to meet in several appointed places and levy one fifteenth and tenth to provide for the defence of the realm.  The eastern counties sent their representatives to Westminster to treat with the council on 9 March, the representatives of the counties south of the Trent met on 18 March, and the communities of the northern shires met in York on 13 April to make the grant of taxation.  No dates were set for payment, but the money was to be levied in two halves and to remain in the control of the shires: one half was to be collected immediately and the other as soon as the purpose of the enemy was known.  The money was to be deposited in cathedral churches or abbeys under the seals of the collectors, and if not required it was to be returned to those who had paid it.  The collectors were to render account not to the Exchequer but to the arrayers of troops.In the event, the forces were not raised, and the sums collected were ordered to be brought to the Exchequer by writs issued at the end of April and on 23 May.  Those men who did sail were not paid and upon their return could not collect the money from the collectors, who had by then brought it to the Exchequer.  At the end of May the king ordered a full-scale inquiry into the collection and payments made in each county.  On the basis of its findings, orders were given to the collectors of each shire on 10 July 1360 to wind up their accounts, and after deducting official expenses, to repay the balance on a pro-rata basis throughout the shire.By the summer of 1360 only £876.8s.4d. had been paid into the Exchequer by the collectors, and they were again summoned under penalty on 18 September to bring the residue, and render their accounts at the Exchequer in the quinzaine of Michaelmas (13 October).  During that term, the Exchequer received a further £2,205.10s.3d. from the subsidy, and more was eventually paid.  Ormrod notes that only c. £6,000 in all came into the Exchequer.(Harriss, |King, Parliament, and Public Finance|, pp 396-400; Ormrod, |Reign of Edward III|, Table 1, p 204, cf.

400,1371 March 28 ,lay subsidy on parishes ,Edward III ,"On 28 March 1371 a new experimental tax on parishes was granted in parliament.  Needing more than the c. £37,000 raised by the levy of a fifteenth and tenth for a new expedition to France, parliament hit upon the scheme of raising £100,000, half each from the clergy and the laity, by means of a levy upon individual parishes which were estimated to number 45,000.The subsidy was to be levied in two equal payments.  On the basis of this number of parishes, it was determined that a national average of 22s.3d. could be raised from each parish, with a certain flexibility built into the levy, which provided for the assistance of poor parishes by richer ones.  The return made from Rutland, indeed, specified which parishes contributed extra sums to subsidise the poorer ones (E 179/165/25).  How the framers of the tax had arrived at the grossly overestimated figure of 45,000 parishes is open to debate, but Prof. Ormrod points out that the figure of 45,002 parishes in England was given in Ranulf Higden\'s |Polychronicon|, a widely-read chronicle.  In fact, the number of parishes was only about 8,600.The collectors had been appointed by commissions on 28 March and received accompanying writs under the privy seal dated 3 April enjoining them to work speedily and efficiently, but by the end of April it was clear that the assessment was radically wrong.  The sheriffs were then instructed to return selected representatives from the last parliament to a great council at Winchester on 8 June and to inform the government by that date of the number of parishes within their counties: on 13 May the king had sent privy seal writs to all the bishops ordering the return of information on the number of parishes in their dioceses in order to corroborate the returns of the sheriffs.  While this was happening, the collectors had begun work and started paying the proceeds of the tax into the Exchequer on 24 May.  When the great council assembled on 8 June, sufficient evidence had been gathered by the crown to indicate that a major increase was necessary in the sums to be paid by each parish, and it was agreed that the amount to be collected was to be raised from 22s.3d. to 116s. per parish.New commissions were immediately issued authorising the collectors to levy the new assessments, and the original dates for payment of instalments at 25 May and 24 June 1371 were accordingly delayed until 11 November 1371 and 28 March 1372.Nevertheless, in spite of the initial administrative problems, this novel subsidy proved a success.  Of the lay contribution over £49,600 was eventually accounted for, most of it by 1374.(|Rot. Parl|., II, pp 303-304; |CCR 1369-1374|, pp 286-287; W.M.

On the following day the chancellor asked for an immediate grant of an aid in view of the continuing war against the French, and stated that all other business, including redress of grievances, was to be postponed until the commons had complied.  After consultation with the bishops and higher nobility, and several days of deliberation, the commons granted the king two fifteenths and tenths on 29 November, each to be collected in two equal instalments.  The grant of the second fifteenth and tenth was conditional upon the continuation of the war.  Another condition of the grant of the tax was that no one who had sat in the parliament which granted it should be asked to participate in its collection, suggesting that there was some apprehension of a popular reaction against the continuing high levels of taxation.  The early 1370s were a time of rising tensions, during which the old and ailing king became increasingly isolated from his own court and the polity at large.The first fifteenth and tenth was to be paid on 2 February 1374 and 21 May 1374, and commissions for collection of both payments were issued on 6 December 1373.

The session ended on 22 February, when the commons departed and the magnates and bishops went to the king, who was by then at Richmond, to inform him of the outcome of the parliament. Probably between 16 and 19 February, it granted a poll tax of 4d. per head on every man and woman over the age of 14 years, with the exception of honest beggars.  The commons asked that four magnates be appointed from among those assembled to act as guardians and treasurers of the sums collected, and to ensure that the receipts were expended for military purposes only.  Initially they also demanded that the chancellor not be allowed to meddle with the tax or have access to any of the sums received, although this demand was later dropped.  Commissions for the assessment and collection of the tax were issued on 4 March and the sheriffs were ordered to assist in the collection of the tax.  Payment was due by 6 April 1377. The commissioners were empowered to call before them two men and the constable from every taxation unit (two men and the bailiff in the case of boroughs) to assess the tax.  This procedure for local assessment remained in place for the levy of the poll taxes granted in 1379 and 1380.  These men were to collect the tax locally and deliver it by indenture to the commissioners.A compilation of returns copied from the enrolled accounts during the reign of either Elizabeth or James I, giving the total amount received, as well as the total number of taxpayers, in each county and city, exists among the Exchequer miscellanea at E 163/16/11.

438,1340 April 3 ,two ninths and fifteenths and tax on wool ,Edward III ,"Parliament was assembled on 29 March 1340 and on 3 April the lords and commons granted a ninth of corn, wool, and sheep (&#8216;the ninth sheaf, the ninth fleece, and the ninth lamb&#8217;) for two years.  This basic grant was subject to modification for certain classes of people. Town-dwellers were to pay a ninth of the value of all their moveables, while rural merchants, people living in forests or wastes, and those who did not live by growing crops or sheep-farming, were to pay a fifteenth of the value of theirs. The first year&#8217;s payment was due on 1 November 1340, and that of the second year on 2 February 1341. The proceeds of this tax, expected to reach £100,000 in each year, were explicitly reserved for the war with France and its administration was placed in the hands of the baronial council in England, headed by the archbishop of Canterbury and the earl of Huntingdon.The novel part of this tax, which comprised a payment in kind, was based on the ecclesiastical tithe, and had in fact originally been proposed in the form of a tenth for two years at a session of the lords in the parliament held the previous October.  Some such innovation seemed necessary because of the severe depletion of the money supply, and it was perhaps also thought that the revenue from such a tax would exceed that from a similar levy in money.  This scheme necessarily involved the revival of the parish as a local taxation unit for a lay subsidy (for instance, it had previously been utilized for the Saladin tithe of 1188), although in at least some of the cases where a parish was composed of several vills, the vill continued to be the ultimate unit of assessment.Letters patent dated 20 April appointed men in each county to assess, by inquisition or otherwise, the value of the ninth and fifteenth in each parish, borough, and city, and to collect or arrange for the sale of the goods.  Supervisors, who were either prelates or magnates, were appointed in each county to oversee this process.  At about this time, it seems, the assessors were further advised that the goods from each parish were to be sold at a value exceeding that normally paid by the church towards the clerical subsidies - that is, the amount registered in the ecclesiastical taxation of Pope Nicholas IV made in 1291.The goods themselves would hardly be available before the seasons of shearing and harvest, which explains why the first payment date was no earlier than November, but the council apparently intended that those persons who agreed to buy the goods should hand over their money in advance and that each taxpayer would later deliver his assessed amount directly to the purchaser. This may have been why the officials were instructed to sell the goods, wherever possible, to people of the same parish, as long as they were ready to pay as much as could be got for them elsewhere, preference being given in the first instance to the rector or farmer of the parish church.  In other words, at the lowest level, the administration of the tax would be as far as possible identical with that employed for the gathering of the tithe, and the goods required from each taxpayer would simply represent an addition to those that they contributed to the church. Only after the parish folk had been approached in vain were the local officials to look elsewhere to make the sale.  The assessors were instructed to take sufficient security from the purchasers, but did not collect the money themselves.  On 6 and 12 May receivers (generally abbots and priors) were appointed in each county to gather the money and pass it in turn to two principal receivers commissioned for the districts north and south of the Trent, who were to keep the revenue in the treasury of York Minster and the Tower of London before transmitting it to the king.The subsequent history of the tax is complicated.  Problems caused by the shortage of coin and the high prices fixed for the sale of produce were compounded by the general weariness of taxation and resistance to the novelty of the tax.  By the end of 1340, only £15,000 had been received.  Yet the money was urgently needed: before the king sailed, at least £200,000 of the subsidy had already been assigned, particularly to merchants of the societies of the Bardi and Peruzzi, and to William de la Pole, in return for loans of money.  The king&#8217;s officials thus resorted to various measures designed to speed up the collection.At the next parliament, which began on 12 July 1340, further debate was had concerning the operation of the tax, which was said to have been disrupted by the actions of the &#8216;lords of the towns&#8217; and other &#8216;troublemakers&#8217; (|barettours|).  As a result, revised instructions (\'the second commission\') were issued to the assessors, who were directed that, although the ninth should still be sold at as high a price as possible, it might be sold if necessary at a price equal to the value of the parish church according to the 1291 tax (E 179/113/13 m 2, the \'second commission\' for Gloucestershire, is dated 15 July 1340).  If they were unable to sell the ninth at the stated value, they should commit it to the lords of the towns for that amount, and such lords would then be answerable to the king (by the hands of the receivers) for the proceeds.  If the lords were unwilling to co-operate, the goods were to be committed to four lawful men of the town, who would similarly be held responsible.  The names of these lords and men were then to be certified to the principal receivers.  \'This\', as E B Fryde notes, \'amounted to a forced sale of the ninth\'.  The assessors were also instructed that if they had made any sales below the tax of the churches, they should be revoked with all haste.  In addition to this, the bishops were directed to summon before them the parsons of their churches to ascertain their correct values.  This measure, however, raised hopes that the minimum sale price for the ninth might be lowered further still, and led some assessors to arrest their operations altogether. In the same parliament, the burden upon the country was increased by the grant of a loan of 20,000 sacks of wool, the repayment of which was to be a first charge on the second year of the ninth.  The collection of this, as may be imagined, was no more successful than that of the subsidy itself and helped to foment the rising discontent.  The Cistercian order was able to procure an exemption from the levy of the ninth on 18 July 1340, following its petition to the king.  It agreed instead to pay a subsidy of one-tenth of their annual income.Further modifications followed.  On 24 August new supervisors were appointed in all the counties, while on 7 September the assessors were taken to task for failing in their duties and were directed that half of the money should be in the hands of the receivers by 1 November.  This was, however, impossible.  The mounting pressure led officials to indulge in illegal seizures and extortion, which generated further local resistance.  In September collectors were assaulted in Somerset, and in October the council received reports of communities refusing outright to pay the sums assessed upon them.  No manner of enforcement seemed adequate to meet the defiance in the country, and the failure of the council to supply the king with funds brought his campaign to a halt.On 27 November it was ordered that the money collected was to be brought to a central collector, William Edington, disregarding any assignments to royal creditors, but three days later the king returned, broke up the council, and embarked on a programme of inquiry into the failure of the tax.  At the beginning of the new year he made an important alteration to the scheme of taxation (\'the third commission\': those for Gloucestershire and Lancashire, E 179/113/13 m 3 and E 179/130/15A, are both dated 26 January 1341): namely, that where the true ninth of the parish did not attain to the assessment of the church according to Pope Nicholas&#8217;s taxation, the true valuation should be levied without regard to the assessment. The money was now expected by mid-Lent (26 March). This alteration seems to have allayed much of the resistance to the levy, or at least the difficulties of putting it into operation, and it has been estimated that the revenue eventually collected from the first year of the subsidy represented a 70 per cent increase on the issues of the customary fifteenth and tenth.  Most of the records connected with this tax which survive in the PRO series E 179 were compiled as a result of the third commission, and they indicate that the first two commissions were executed in only a few parishes.  A sample of these documents is printed in a Record Commission volume under the title |Nonarum Inquisitiones|, though the sample includes not only inquisitions, but also valuation schedules and particulars of account.New assessors were appointed on 11 March 1341 for the second year&#8217;s payment, but in the parliament which opened on 23 April of that year the estates complained that the tax was impoverishing them and the second payment was replaced by a grant of 30,000 sacks of wool.  This commutation has not yet received a satisfactory commentary.  Apparently the first 20,000 sacks were payable by 1 August 1341 and the remaining 10,000 by 24 June 1342, the first year&#8217;s levy being apportioned by parliament among the counties according to the rate of the triennial fifteenth and tenth of 1337.  Conditions attached to the grant specified that it should be collected by local men.  As before, difficulties were experienced in putting the tax into operation.  Magnates and others were appointed in each county on 20 June 1341 to hear complaints connected with the levying of the tax, and as late as December 1343 the county of Northumberland had still not paid the wool charged to it; as a result, writs were sent to the local collectors demanding their returns.  Moreover, the articles of oyer and terminer commissions issued at the behest of the 1343 parliament suggest that the collectors were also suspected of collecting more than they delivered, selling good fleeces and replacing them with substandard ones, or taking money in place of fleeces and purchasing substandard ones for delivery to the king.

466,1374 June 10 x Aug 1 ,"grant of £1,000 from the commonalty of Kent ",Edward III ,"On 10 June 1374, the sheriff of Kent was instructed to issue summonses for appearance before an eyre of justices in the county which would commence on 11 August. The appointment of an eyre was a right traditionally enjoyed by the king in times of voidance of the archbishopric of Canterbury, and upon the death of the last archbishop, William, the king appointed certain justices to hold the eyre, whereupon the abbot of St. Augustine\'s Canterbury, John de Cobham and William Pympe came to the king and council and offered him £1,000 instead.  The king must have accepted the offer by 1 August, when the sheriff of Kent was informed of the agreement and that the summons to all those who should have appeared was now void. It was not until 4 August 1374, however, that five commissioners were appointed in Kent to collect a grant or fine of £1,000 offered to the king by the commonalty of the county in exchange for the release and remission from the appointment of an eyre of justices in the county.  Taking into consideration the \'freely bestowed goodwill\' of the commonalty and \'the good bearing which he has always found in them and hopes to find even more readily in future\', he pardoned them half the amount, \'to the end that the poor and impotent of the commonalty may be spared\', and appointed the commissioners to collect the remaining £500, and to answer for it at the Exchequer.

471,1347 March 3 ,"forced loan of 20,000 sacks of wool ",Edward III ,"During the king\'s absence abroad, his son Lionel of Antwerp summoned a great council at Westminster to devise a means by which to finance the continuation of the war currently being waged by the king in France.  This council met on 3 March 1347 and \'granted\' the king 20,000 sacks of wool which was termed a \'loan\', although in fact there was little prospect of repayment, since it was to be collected according to the method of assessment devised in 1341.  It was claimed that repayment would be made from the receipts of the three years of the wool subsidy from Michaelmas 1348-1351 granted by the same council.The tax was to be levied upon \'the earls, barons, bannerets, knights, lords of towns and other laymen having lands, rents and goods in cities, boroughs, market-towns and other places, and from the lands and rents of ecclesiastical persons acquired after 20 Edward I at the rate of 14 pounds a stone and 26 stones a sack\'.  Nothing was to be taken from \'cotters and workmen and such simple and poor folk, or from ecclesiastical persons from lands and places pertaining to the fee of the church in the hands of ecclesiastical men, which were annexed to their spiritualities among their temporalities and taxed for a tenth with the clergy of the realm in 20 Edward III\'.  Those refusing to pay would be compelled to pay treble the value of what they had been assessed.Commissions for assessment were issued on 8 March 1347, with each county being given a specific amount of wool to be raised, and in June and July 1347 extra members were added to the commissions to accelerate the process.  Assessment was to be made by the feast of St. Peter |ad vincula| (1 August) and certification of the wool and money received was to be made in Chancery before Michaelmas (29 September).  On 10 June 1347, orders were sent out to the collectors in each county to levy the loan in wool, or in money, at set amounts per sack for each county.  Theoretically, one could pay in either wool or cash, but in practice there appears to have been little choice, as the crown was anxious to turn a large profit by selling the wool abroad through a syndicate of English merchants who were given a monopoly of sale and the farm of the customs for three years from Michaelmas 1348.  It was later alleged in parliament that anyone who had wished to pay cash had to pay 2s.6d. to 3s. in the pound more than the value of the wool.  In Suffolk, the tax was levied in both wool and cash, and in London, Middlesex, Kent, Devon and Cornwall the assessment was made entirely in cash.  Almost all was given in cash in Surrey, while Norfolk paid two-thirds in cash, and Sussex and Bedfordshire supplied almost half in cash; five other counties gave small proportions in cash.  The remainder of the counties, however, were assessed entirely in wool. When parliament opened on 14 January 1348, the collection and export of the wool was still taking place, and there were a multitude of complaints about the administration of the tax, in particular that the merchants had used it for their own profit, and that the embargo on sales of wool (imposed in an effort to combat resistance by lesser wool merchants) had made it difficult for the commons to levy the fifteenths and tenths granted in 1346.  Extortion and fraud by collectors was also said to be widespread, and the customs farmers surrendered their monopoly of export.  In addition, the conclusion of a truce in September 1347 had led to widespread rumours that the levy would not be made, and resistance when it was.  Edward ignored the complaints, absolved the merchants from having to answer for their honesty, and never repaid the loan.(|CFR 1347-56|, pp. 1-15; T.H.

483,1337 July 21 ,subsidy in aid of the king\'s French expedition ,Edward III ,"On 21 June 1337, needing to raise money for his approaching expedition to France, Edward III summoned a council of bishops, abbots, lords and other important persons to meet at Westminster on 21 July and discuss ways of procuring funds.  At that conference it was decided to proceed with the war and to collect a subsidy from the laity and the clergy, in the event that the parliament which was to be summoned to meet on 26 September would not grant the king a fifteenth and tenth or other form of subsidy sufficient for his needs.Writs were issued from the Chancery to all sheriffs, commanding them to have it proclaimed in the cities, boroughs and elsewhere in their counties that all the substantial persons of the county - clergy, nobles, merchants and other wealthy men - should assemble at specified places within the county on 15 September.  On the same day, similar writs were sent to the bishops and archbishops ordering an assembly of all clergy on various days; in the archdiocese of York, the meeting was to take place at York on 10 September.  They were to assemble \'to hear the king\'s intention and will concerning the defence of the realm against the king of France\', which was to be delivered to them by commissioners appointed for this purpose.  Those refusing to come were threatened with punishment for their disobedience.  They were to be shown \'how the king is obliged to spend great sums of money for the war\' and to be induced \'to grant a subvention in alleviation of those expenses, informing the king with all speed of what they shall grant, to cause the schedule setting forth this matter to be published in every church of the diocese and in other fitting places\' .The tax was not levied uniformly thoughout the country.  A memorandum returned into Chancery by the bishop of Coventry and Lichfield provides unique information about how the subsidy was raised in Staffordshire.  It survives in two copies and gives details of the assemblies that met in the county for this purpose (E 179/242/37, 38).  A meeting took place at Stafford on 9 September at which the bishop, Ralph Basset senior and Roger de Swynnerton showed the schedule to high-ranking clergy, lords, knights, merchants and other substantial persons.  Because the sheriff had only received the writ on 6 September, attendance was sparse, for which reason, as well as the professed poverty of those who did turn up, the assembly was prorogued until 16 September.  Meanwhile, the clergy of the diocese of Coventry and Lichfield met at Stafford on 15 September and, after a reading of the schedule sent to the bishop, granted to the king a subsidy of 12d. for each mark of taxation of temporalities and spiritualities, payable in two instalments, at Michaelmas (29 September 1337) and the feast of the Purification of the Virgin (2 February 1338).Following their lead, the knights, lords and merchants held their prorogued assembly on the next day and, after breaking up into discussion groups according to their social status, granted a subsidy of 12d. per pound, assessed on land, which was to be levied in accordance with an extent made in the county in 18 Edward II (1324-5).  That extent had been returned into Chancery, but a copy remained in the hands of one of the commissioners involved in making the survey, Sir Philip de Somervill, and was available for their use.  This survey was the basis, then, of another list made in 1337 of landholders and the total values of their holdings, ranging from £5-£40 per annum.  The 1337 list has been identified by R.H. Hilton as the assessment for the levy of this tax, and was used by him for a study of land tenancy in that county (SC 12/1/32).  From this assessment, it would appear that the threshold of liability for the tax in Staffordshire was 100s.At a series of meetings held by the merchants of the towns in Staffordshire on 16 and 18 September it was agreed that the towns (which included boroughs and ancient demesne estates), would provide lump sum contributions, a pattern which was duplicated elsewhere, in both towns and counties.  The contributions expected from the individual towns were listed in the memorandum; they range from 100s., to be raised in Stafford, to 1/2 mark, the amount agreed to be paid by each of the towns of Tutbury and Walsall.When parliament met on 26 September 1337, the laity granted three fifteenths and tenths to be paid over three years and the clergy granted a subsidy in convocation, whereupon this subsidy was cancelled, and the collectors were ordered to credit all monies collected to the fifteenths and tenths.  Nevertheless, writs for the collection of the subsidy had been issued, and returns were made by several, but not all, counties.  Most of these are recorded in the Exchequer receipt rolls (E 401).  The writ issued to the king\'s clerk John de Thorp to collect the subsidy in Essex and Hertfordshire was dated 16 September, and requested payment by the Hertfordshire men on 20 September at Ware, and by the Essex men on 21 September at Chelmsford.  No information on how the tax was levied in these counties is available, however.The commissions to levy the tax in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, dated 15 September 1337, specified that collection of the money was to take place by 29 September at the latest, and gave the further information that only men possessing lands, goods and chattels exceeding the value of 20s. were to be taxed.  They also reveal that both counties opted to raise lump sums from their inhabitants; the total sum granted by the county of Nottingham was £700 (£100 of which was to come from Nottingham, Newark, Blyth and Retford) and that granted by Derbyshire was £400 - roughly comparable with the yield of a fifteenth and tenth.  It is also known that London gave 1,000 marks.  Some counties, such as Yorkshire, paid only part of their quota before the subsidy was cancelled, but London\'s contribution was received in total in September.  Money was still being received as late as February 1339.(|CCR 1337-39|, pp 186, 254-255; |CFR 1337-47|, pp 42-43; J.F.

609,1347 May 24 - July 4 ,forced loan ,Edward III ,"In 1346-7, Edward III was desperately short of money, and instigated what might be regarded as the first general appeal for loans to the crown.  On 24 May 1347 he sent writs to the heads of religious houses commanding them to appear before his council, and on 4 July 1347 similar writs were issued to sheriffs and laymen in all counties.  It is evident that the intention was to negotiate loans with them, and a certain amount of reluctance can be perceived from the fact that follow-up writs had to be sent to many of the laymen summoned, on both 20 August and 15 September.Yet, it seems that the appeal was successful; Mark Ormrod has noted that the Exchequer managed to collect about £11,000 from lenders outside the merchant syndicates which had previously underwritten Edward\'s foreign campaigns.  An original letter patent dated 1 December 1347 authorising repayment of a loan of £28 made by the prior of Christchurch, Canterbury provides evidence of what was probably a typical loan raised by this public appeal; it was not to be repaid until Christmas of the following year (E 34/1B).(|CCR 1346-1349|, pp 284-288, 360-362, 375-380, 390-392; Harriss, \'Aids, Loans and Benevolences\', p 15; W.M.

624,1337 Oct 10 or earlier ,scutage ,Edward III ,"In 1337, Edward III\'s financial difficulties led to an attempt to impose a scutage in connection with the Scottish campaign of 1327, for which a summons had been issued on 5 April 1327, when fines had been levied at £20 per fee.  On 10 October 1337, writs were issued to collectors instructing them to hold inquisitions.\'The imposition of a new levy was, on account of the protracted and still unsettled controversy over the earlier scutages, intensely unpopular\', and in the parliament of 3 February 1338 the collection was indefinitely suspended, in view of the fact that the commons had granted a subsidy.Although returns of assessments for several counties are in the E 179 class, no money was collected.  A half-hearted attempt to revive the collection was made in September 1338, but with no satisfactory result, and the pardon of debts arising from this scutage was included in the general pardon of outstanding debts granted by Edward in 1340.  The Warwickshire collector, accounting in 1341, claimed that he was unable to collect any of the money (E 179/192/9).  The period for which he accounted ran from 9 October 1337 (curiously, the day before the issue of the writs took place) to 16 February 1338, and the latter date may represent the date on which writs were issued to the collectors suspending the collection. On the other hand the Hampshire collectors, who also claimed to have been unable to collect any money, accounted for the period 10 October 1337 to 6 February 1338 (E 179/173/9).(Chew, \'Scutage in the fourteenth century\', |EHR|, XXXVIII (1923), pp 19-41) ",Origin  Imposed,
653,1338 July 26 x Aug 1 ,"grant of 17,500 sacks of wool ",Edward III ,"On 26 July 1338 a great council convened at Northampton and during the course of its session, authorized a grant of wool.  This was the second attempt to collect the wool which remained outstanding after the failure of the wool scheme of 1337, which had aimed to raise £200,000 for the king\'s war in France by acquiring and selling 30,000 sacks of wool on his behalf.  This scheme had been agreed at a conference held between the government and leading wool merchants, but an attempt to recover the 20,000 sacks remaining after the scheme had come to a halt in the winter of 1337-8 was made by a grant in the Parliament which met in February 1338. It was not only the laity who were liable to contribute wool, but also certain prelates, abbots, priors and other clergy who agreed to pay in Parliament (see |CFR 1337-47|, pp. 98-9; E 179/279/103).  Now, it was thought that 17,500 sacks of wool had still not been acquired for the king and he was anxious to raise them as quickly as possible.Although this appears to be further confirmation of the king\'s right to levy the 30,000 sacks as initially planned, there were some new aspects to this grant.  New wool, from the forthcoming season, might now be taken, as well as old, wool already shorn and in stock.  A new method of collection was to be employed, since the tax was to be apportioned according to the schedules of assessment used for fifteenths and tenths, at the rate of ten stones of wool for every 20s. of the assessment paid to the fifteenth and pro rata for the tenth.  All those lay persons who paid at a tenth had their assessments reduced by a third before the calculation of their quota of wool. It is clear that the clergy asked to pay were assessed in accordance with the 1291 assessment of ecclesiastical wealth (see E 179/63/2A).On 1 August, the officers of the Exchequer were sent a list of those men who had been appointed to assess and levy the wool in the various parts of the country and were instructed to transcribe and send to these men the relevant assessment rolls; the wool was to be at specified collection points by 2 September. This apparently included a list of \'prelates and religious\' who were liable to pay the tax, most, if not all of whom, are listed in the surviving particulars of account of the subcollectors appointed in the diocese of York (E 179/63/2A). Later, it was provided that those who had no wool might pay the value in money.In April 1339, London compounded for its contribution by a payment of 1,000 marks (100 marks less than it was taxed towards the fifteenths), and the city of York, which paid £162 at a tenth, made a fine of £108.  Barnes has pointed out the unfairness of fixing a uniform price across the country, since &#8216;the value of wool varied greatly in the different counties&#8217;, yet the tax was a comparative success.  Fryde has calculated that the gross assessment amounted to 15,300 sacks, and the greater part of this was realized by August 1339.  The tax eventually provided the equivalent of 14,000 sacks.|CPR 1338-1340|, pp 244-245; |CCR 1337-1339|, pp 457, 584; F R Barnes, \'The Taxation of Wool, 1327-1348\' in |Finance and Trade under Edward III| ed.

Wool Scheme, 26 July 1337The king was in need of large amounts of money to finance the war against the French and in the summer of 1337, an agreement was made which was to use the wool trade for raising the money as quickly as possible.  On 26 July 1337, an assembly of the government and leading wool merchants was held, during which an indenture of agreement was drawn up, creating what amounted to a royal monopoly on wool.  The proceeds of 30,000 sacks of wool, thought to be the equivalent of the £200,000 required for the war, would be lent to the king, who would also receive half the profits of the sale of the wool on the Continent.  An earlier trade embargo had created the right conditions for selling English wool at high prices and the venture was envisaged to be highly lucrative.At the same assembly, purveyors of wool were appointed; ninety-nine merchants were divided into groups and each group was assigned to purchase wool compulsorily in a county or group of counties.  For the best wools, a schedule of minimum wool prices drawn up at Nottingham the previous September would be used; for wool of a lesser quality, the merchants would be able to bargain for a price.  The merchants were to pay half the amount due within six months of receiving the wool and the other half, within the year.  A feature of the scheme was that those providing wool were to be given a personal bond of the merchant and not royal letters obligatory, so that, in effect, the credit of merchants was used by the king to obtain wool for himself; the purveyors would be repaid from a fund created out of customs payments.The wool was to be taken in three shipments to Dordrecht and the king was to be paid in three instalments, at Christmas 1337, Easter (12 April) 1338 and Ascension (21 May 1338), each of 100,000 marks.The two leading merchants, William de la Pole of Hull and Reginald Conduit of London, were given several areas of responsibility:  they were put in charge of the disposal of the wool, care of the king\'s share of the profits, repayment of the merchants and collection of all the payments of customs with which to reimburse them.  When the king later imprisoned or prosecuted advisers and officials charged with mismanagement of his affairs, these two merchants were also arrested and put on trial for their part in the later breakdown of the wool scheme, amongst accusations of dishonesty.The scheme appears to have run into difficulties towards the end of 1337, involving disputes between the king\'s agents and representatives of the merchants in the Netherlands, leading ultimately to the handing over of the wool to the king\'s agents - the so-called \'Dordrecht seizure\' - from February to at least May 1338.  The value of the wool taken into the king\'s hands is thought to have been £114,000, but the amount of wool represented by this figure is disputed by historians.  Disagreements over the disposal of the wool almost brought the scheme to a halt, but the king was still determined to raise the 30,000 sacks he initially planned to acquire.  This led to a subsequent grant of wool, to recover the number of sacks outstanding, as outlined below.|CPR 1334-1338|, pp. 480-482; |CCR 1337-1339|, pp. 97, 148-150; T. H.

VII, pp. 212-13.Grant of 20,000 sacks of wool, 3 x 14 February 1338Following the breakdown of the attempt to raise 30,000 sacks of wool on behalf of the king in the winter of 1337-1338, Parliament assembled at Westminster on 3 February 1338 and during the session, granted Edward half the wool in the country, \'for the furtherance of urgent business\'.  The amount of wool was calculated to be 20,000 sacks and rather than being considered a new grant, this was seen as confirmation of the king\'s right to levy the remainder of the 30,000 sacks to be raised under the agreement with the merchants made the previous year.Previously, ninety-nine merchants had been appointed purveyors of wool; using a combination of fixed prices and bargaining, they were to pay half the price within six months of the wool being delivered and the other half within a year.  Those who surrendered wool were not given royal letters obligatory, but the personal bonds of the merchants.  In 1338, up to half of each individual\'s stock of wool was to be requisitioned and the price paid according to quality.  Now, royal letters obligatory were to be given in exchange, for repayment within two years.Commissions to the purveyors and takers of the wool were issued on 26 March 1338 to take the wool to the ports before Easter and prepare it for shipping.  The purveyors were also to certify to the king the amount of wool taken.The results of this levy met with resistance and were disappointing.  No wool was exported before July 1338 and when the king left England on 16 July, it was calculated that fewer than 2,000 sacks had been received, although this estimate was later revised to 2,500 sacks.  On 24 July, Edward wrote in complaint to the council, urging them to raise the remaining 17,500 sacks as soon as possible, which resulted in a further grant being made at the end of July by the Great Council at Northampton (see notes to that grant).|CPR 1334-1338|, pp. 480-482, |CCR 1337-1339|, p. 401, T.

Later in the year, on 21 October, similarly following a grant by the southern convocation, the province of York was convened for a second time and made a further grant of a tenth, to be collected directly following the first tenth voted in May. The tax was thus levied as one subsidy of two tenths, to be collected in four instalments: on 2 February and 24 June 1337, and on 2 February and 24 June 1338.The grant was made on condition that no royal agent should take any goods from any of the clergy of the northern province.  A condition attached to the grants made by both provinces was that the imposition on the English clergy of six tenths by Pope John XXII be revoked, since royal and papal tenths were not to be levied concurrently.  Anything collected by papal agents was to be offset against the two tenths which the clergy had granted to the king.  In the event, the papal tenths were revoked.Gross receipts for each tenth in both provinces were about £19,000.(|CFR 1337-1347|, pp 16-17; |CCR 1337-1339|, pp 79-81; W E Lunt, \'The Collectors of Clerical Subsidies\', in |English Government at Work 1327-1336|, ed.

694,1333 July 26 ,six papal tenths ,Edward III ,"On 26 Jul 1333 Pope John XXII imposed a tax of a tenth of the clergy\'s income for six years to finance a crusade scheduled to begin on 1 August 1336.  Because the clergy was still in process of paying the tenths imposed by the pope for four years in 1330, there was a long delay in the publication of the pope\'s mandate by the English clergy, and it was decided that the combined length of the two levies was to be only six years.  This tax was to be levied, therefore, for only two years, and the English bishops did not appoint deputy collectors until December 1335.The tax began to be collected in 1336, the same year that both provinces of the clergy granted two clerical tenths to the king.  The first tenth was to be paid on 2 February and 24 June 1337, and the second on the same dates in the following years.  On 18 December 1336 the pope revoked his bull of 1333 and ordered the bishops to give back the tax money to those who had paid it.  This revocation only became effective in England after 2 February 1337, after one-half of the first tenth was collected.  The remaining one and a half tenths were never levied.(W E Lunt, \'The Collectors of Clerical Subsidies\', in |English Government at Work 1327-1336|, ed.

716,1371 May 3 - July 10 ,"clerical subsidy of £50,000 ",Edward III ,"On 28 March 1371 a new experimental tax on parishes was granted in parliament, which was expected to raise £100,000.  Half of this sum was to come from the taxation of the clergy; only £5,000 was to be paid by the northern province.  The clergy of Canterbury province was expected to pay the remaining £45,000 - a massive sum, bearing in mind that the net proceeds of a tenth from both provinces was only £16,000.  The southern clergy confirmed the grant only with great reluctance; they met on 12 April, and it was not until 3 May that the assembly was dissolved, having conceded the tax to the king.  The convocation of the northern province met and granted the £5,000 expected of them on 10 July.These sums obviously could not be raised by the levy of the conventional tenth.  The king\'s writ ordering collection in the southern province, dated 5 May 1371, widened the net of payers of the tax to include all those normally exempt.  All exemptions and privileges previously granted were to be overriden on this occasion.  Each bishop was to assemble the clergy of his diocese on a given day and place so that an assessment of the unassessed clergy could be made.  No appeals were to be made by anyone claiming exemption, and anyone refusing to pay was to be certified to Chancery by the bishop.On 14 May the archbishop of Canterbury issued his instructions to the bishops for the collection of the tax in the southern province, ordering that the clergy be assembled in accordance with the king\'s instructions to discover the annual value of unassessed benefices (that is, those benefices not valued in the |Taxatio| of 1291).  He enclosed also a further set of instructions, apparently issued by the king\'s council, setting out the rates to be paid (printed in McHardy, |Clerical Poll-Taxes of the Diocese of Lincoln 1377-1381|, pp 189-190).  Assessed benefices were to be taxed at a rate of one and a half tenths of their income, and unassessed benefices were to be taxed at one-tenth of two-thirds of their value.  This was the general rule, and members of the clergy, including the normally exempt (such as Hospitallers), were to pay at these rates on both their assessed and unassessed benefices.  Stipendiary chaplains (i.e., unbeneficed clergy) were to pay one-tenth of the true value of their stipends.  The tax was to be paid in two instalments: on 29 September 1371 and 2 February 1372.The administration of the tax was predictably beset with many problems.  Many clergy who owned property unassessed in 1291 paid taxes with the laity, and they were anxious not to be taxed twice over.  There were also protests from the Hospitallers, who claimed that they had always paid taxes with the laity, and on 8 September 1371 a royal mandate was issued ordering that they were not to be taxed with the clergy.  Much resistance to the tax was also encountered by the collectors, and although the whole £50,000 was never collected, over £42,000 had been received by September 1374.No documentary evidence of the collection of this tax survives apart from a schedule of arrears due for both payments of the tax from clergy in the archdeaconries of Suffolk and Sudbury, in the diocese of Norwich (now E 179/45/1B).

224,1463 June 17 ,"aid of £37,000/fifteenth and tenth ",Edward IV ,"Parliament opened on 29 April 1463.  By 17 June, the last day of the session, Edward IV had announced his intention to lead an army against the Scots and asked the commons to grant him an aid of £37,000 - the equivalent of a fifteenth and tenth.  Indeed, £31,000 of this sum was to be raised like the last fifteenth and tenth, although exemption from payment was given to all persons with lands or tenements worth less than 10s. per annum, or goods and chattels worth less than 5 marks, and inhabitants of the town of Great Yarmouth.  It was payable in two equal instalments on 1 August 1463 and 11 November 1463.The other £6,000, normally deducted from the grant of a fifteenth and tenth for distribution among impoverished areas, was to be levied as an income tax.  The tax was payable by all those who held lands worth 20s. or more, or who possessed moveable goods worth at least 10 marks, and was due to be paid on 1 August 1463.  The amount of individual contributions was left to the discretion of the commissioners appointed on 1 July 1463 to levy both the £31,000 and the £6,000.  The total amount of the £31,000 charged to each county was the same as for the traditional fifteenth and tenth, and the amounts due from each locality for the levy of the £6,000 were to correspond with the county\'s usual share of the £6,000 deduction for impoverished places.Both parts of the aid were to be used expressly for the defence of the realm only.  Preparations were being made for the assembly of the king\'s forces in the month of August, and in anticipation, the king moved to York in September, remaining in the county until January 1464, but the Scottish campaign never came to fruition.  The larger part of the aid, as well as a subsidy voted by convocation, was used to pay the Calais garrison and meet other of the king\'s heavy obligations, in contravention of the conditions laid down by the commons.When parliament, which had been prorogued on 17 June, began a new session on 4 November 1463, widespread resentment was reflected in the commons\' demand that the £6,000 be remitted, and that collection of the second half of the £31,000 be deferred to a later date.  They claimed that their agreement to the original features of the levy had been but provisional, insisting that they had delivered their \'paper\' only as \'a remembrance of their intent\', and reserving the right to alter the conditions of the grant if they wished.  In response, the \'aid\' of £31,000 was formally converted into a normal fifteenth and tenth, minus the standard deduction, the date of the second payment was duly changed to 25 March 1464, and the £6,000 was remitted by the king.  All assignments made on the aid of £31,000 were to be honoured by the collectors of the fifteenth and tenth, and fresh commissions were to be issued for its collection.For the most part, surviving accounts among the E 179 documents cite the original date scheduled for the second payment (11 November 1463) as the date of the first payment, and 25 March 1464 as the date of the second payment.  Those collectors, however, who received and acted upon commissions for collection of the first payment before the alterations made in the conditions of the levy on 4 November 1463, cite 1 August as the date of the first payment.

225,1468 May 17 x June 6 ,two fifteenths and tenths ,Edward IV ,"The prorogued parliament which had begun on 3 June 1467 re-assembled for its third session on 12 May 1468.  On 17 May, the chancellor informed the assembly that the king had concluded a series of treaties of alliance, most notably with the duchies of Burgundy and Brittany, and intended to invade France.  The commons thereupon voted the king a grant of two fifteenths and tenths, minus the standard deduction of £6,000 per fifteenth and tenth, and letters patent for both collection and distribution of the deduction were issued on 6 June 1468 (E 179/120/98). The inhabitants of both Lincoln and Great Yarmouth were excused from the levy.The tax was payable in four equal instalments over two years - on 11 November 1468, 25 March 1469, 11 November 1469 and 25 March 1470.  The proposed invasion again never came off, fostering further resentment, and the tax was never fully collected.  There is some evidence that delays were experienced in the levy of the first fifteenth and tenth during these turbulent years.  The accounts of the Surrey and Middlesex collectors, for example, were not audited until Trinity term and Easter term 1472, - over three years after it was due to be paid (E 179/184/111 and E 179/141/92).  Part of the second fifteenth and tenth remained unpaid in November 1472, when remission of the outstanding sum due was made a condition of the grant of the subsidy for 13,000 archers.(|Rot.

226,1473 April 8 - 1474 July 18 ,fifteenth and tenth ,Edward IV ,"Prorogued from October 1472, parliament began another session on 8 February 1473.  On 8 April, the commons declared that because returns from the 1472 subsidy had not yet been received from all the counties, the total amount raised by its levy was still unknown.  Since the wages of the 13,000 archers needed to be paid, they now granted a fifteenth and tenth, less the standard £6,000 deduction, by means of an indenture drawn up between the king and the commons.  Like the 1472 income tax, the levy of the tax was to occur only if the king led an expedition to France by Michaelmas 1474.  The money collected was to be used solely for the payment of the archers\' wages and was to be held in local repositories until the proclamation of the army musters.  The whole sum was initially to be paid by 24 June 1473, but on accepting the grant, the king deferred payment until 29 September.At a sixth session of parliament, which began on 6 June 1474 and was again prorogued on 18 July 1474, however, the commons explained on the last day of the session that it was now known that the income tax of 1472 had yielded but £31,410 14s.1&#189;d.  Returns from the northern counties and a few other areas were still not in, however, nor had the fifteenth and tenth been collected.  Because the deadline for the king\'s departure for France, imposed by the grant of both the 1472 income tax and the fifteenth and tenth, was fast approaching, two measures were taken to prevent the grants from becoming void, again by means of an indenture of agreement between the king and commons.  The deadline for the king\'s departure was extended to 24 June 1476, and the fifteenth and tenth was re-granted, payment being due now on 11 November 1474.(|Rot.

228,1483 Feb 18 ,alien subsidy ,Edward IV ,"Parliament opened on 20 January 1483 and granted an alien subsidy to Edward IV on 18 February, the last day of the session.  The tax was payable on 18 May 1483, by those aliens resident in the realm on 20 January, the first day of the parliament (see for example E 179/180/111, the Suffolk return, where this is made explicit).The rates levied were:Alien artisans who were householders  - 6s.8d.Alien non-householders (except agricultural servants) - 2s. Aliens keeping brewing houses - 20s.Alien householders who were merchants or factors of Venice, Italy, Genoa, Florence, Milan, Lucca, Catalonia, or were Albertines (members of the Florentine society of the Alberti) or Lombards - 40s.Alien non-householders who were merchants or factors, as above - 20s.Spanish, Breton and German merchants were exempt, and the king later exempted Venetians, Genoans, Florentines and Luccans from the tax. The grant makes it clear that where two or more aliens dwelt in a single house they should, nevertheless, each pay the sum due from a householder.Commissions to collect the subsidy were issued on 27 April 1483, during the reign of Edward V and some documents (E 179/117/77, 242/25) suggest that the date of payment was altered to 24 June 1483.  However, E 179/108/130, E 179/136/266, E 179/141/94, E 179/149/177 and E 179/180/111 make it clear that the tax was not collected during Edward IV\'s lifetime, but that on 1 August 1483 Richard III issued letters patent for its collection, ordering payment to be made by Michaelmas (29 September) 1483.  Further letters patent were issued by him on 18 February 1484 to collect the subsidy on 2 May 1484 in Kent, Hampshire, Yorkshire, Rutland and Somerset.The tax was levied with a certain amount of vigour and many returns survive.  The assessments of aliens in London and Middlesex are calendared in J. Bolton (ed.), |The Alien Communities of London in the Fifteenth Century: the Subsidy Rolls of 1440, 1483-84|, (Stamford, 1998) (E 179/242/25, 269/34, 141/94-5).  In addition to the commissions for levying the tax, and the inquests and accounts scattered throughout the E 179 class and listed under the individual counties, there is also a file of commissions and inquests for various cities and counties in E 179/236/130.(|Rot.

472,1474 Nov - Dec ,benevolence ,Edward IV ,"Despite the taxes recently granted to Edward IV and due to be paid in 1475, he was still in need of money to fund the French campaign, especially since payment of the first quarter\'s wages for the army was due on 31 January 1475, and money was also needed for ordnance, artillery, ships and supplies.  It was decided by the king and his council, therefore, that a \'benevolence\' - a free gift traditionally offered in lieu of military service, and leviable by royal prerogative, for the defence of the realm - would be imposed upon the wealthier of the king\'s subjects.The levy of the benevolence was reported by several chroniclers, but the most substantial account of it appears in the London chronicle, from which it is evident that the campaign to raise funds began there.  The mayor and aldermen of the city came before the king and offered various sums - £30 from the former and amounts ranging from £10-20 marks from each alderman.  The king then sent for the commoners of the city, most of whom granted him £4.11s.3d. - the equivalent of the wages of half a man, at 6d. a day, for a year. The king, probably in mid or late November 1474, then extended his campaign for funds to the provinces.  According to a letter written on 17 March 1475 by a Milanese visitor to England, the king had personally toured the countryside for the last four months, soliciting contributions.  After local enquiries about the wealth of the inhabitants, he summoned each targeted individual before him, welcoming him \'as if he had known him always\', and asked him what he was prepared to give.  If the amount offered was unacceptable, the king appealed to his pride, telling him of a neighbour poorer than he who had pledged to contribute more.  One chronicle reported that a rich Suffolk widow raised her contribution from £10 to £20, in return for a kiss from the king.  By these subtle and not-so-subtle means, described by the Italian correspondent as having \'plucked out the feathers of his magpies without making them cry out\', the king undoubtedly met with some success.  In this work, he was also aided by specially-appointed commissioners.A copy of a commission, dated 21 December 1474, issued under the privy seal to the mayor and eight other citizens of Coventry and transcribed into the Coventry Leet Book, describes in part the procedure they were to follow.  They were to explain the king\'s purpose to invade France and his immediate need for funds, and to urge the persons on the list annexed to the commission, who had not already agreed to donate money in the king\'s presence, to do so.  The contributions promised were to be recorded in sealed \'billes\', which were to be forwarded to the king and remain with him, and were expressly not to be delivered into the Exchequer or any other court of record.  The commissioners were directed to accept promises of payment in two instalments, the first of which was to be on 1 February 1475, just before the king was due to pay wages to the army, and the second on 1 May, when he was to call the general muster.  An original commission for the levy of the benevolence in Berkshire is now BL, Cotton MS Cleo F.VI, fos 245v-246.Three days later, further instructions were issued under the king\'s signet to the mayor and sheriff of Coventry.  All those enjoying an income (from lands, offices or fees) of £10 per annum or more, or in possession of moveable goods worth £100 or more, were to appear before the king on the following Monday (26 December), when their names and the values of their estates were to be certified in writing.  It is clear from these instructions, and the commission that preceded them, that the king\'s initial attempts to procure gifts from his subjects had been deemed insufficient, and that more intensive efforts were required to raise the necessary money.Surviving documents from various stages of the levy of the benevolence, among the documents of the privy seal office confirm the arrangements outlined in the Coventry commission, and reveal further procedural details.  Contributors were obliged to make out promissory notes to the king, some of which were in the form of indented bills; others were simple bills on paper.  In both forms of bill, the contributor bound both himself and his heirs to pay the king a certain sum \'towards his voyage beyond the sea\' in two equal payments.  Eight bills given by men from Somerset and Dorset, all dated between 21 November and 28 December, promise payment on 1 January and 12 May 1475 (E 34/1B).  Slight variations in the agreed payment dates can also be seen.  A copy of a promissory note, dated 20 December 1474 and given by the Norfolk knight Sir William Calthorpe, obliged him to pay Edward IV the sum of £73 in two instalments due on 1 February and 1 May 1475 (C. Louis, |The Commonplace Book of Robert Reynes of Acle, An Edition of Tanner MS 407| (New York and London, 1980), p 111).       True to his word, the king appears not to have involved the Exchequer in the administration of the tax.  One part of the indented bills made with the contributors was probably forwarded to John Elrington, keeper of the king\'s wardrobe and receiver-general of the benevolence, or may have remained with the commissioners, and the other was given to the county receiver.  The county receivers, appointed to collect the benevolence in one or two counties, or part of a county (as in Lincolnshire), were to pay to Elrington all sums received, together with the bills.  Elrington\'s receipt of five bills and just under £53 from Thomas Fowler, receiver in Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire, is attested by an indenture dated 19 June 1475, which also records that two of the bills remained uncollected.  One Rauf Pecche (not the county receiver) acknowledged in writing that he received 25 bills from the privy seal office on 10 July 1475 to be levied in Leicestershire; these represented a total of £37.11s.10d.  Why the privy seal office was in possession of these bills is not clear.  In Rutland, there was a delay in levying the benevolence, for it was not until 7 August 1475 that the commissioners delivered 70 bills to the sheriff, who was evidently also the county receiver, together with a list of contributors and amounts promised, totalling just over £56 (E 34/1B).  The reason for the delay is unknown, but no receipts from Rutland appear in the enrolled account.Nor does the benevolence appear to have been satisfactorily levied in London.  A letter under the king\'s privy seal to the mayor and aldermen of the city, dated 17 June 1475, copied by John Stow, complained that the king knew for certain that there were many persons who had \'not shewed yet theyr benevolence unto our greate voyage\', and appointed them, with the assistance of the king\'s three chief justices and the archdeacon of London, to call before them everyone who appeared to have 100 marks or more in goods, and had not contributed, and induce them to make \'theyre good and loving graunts\'.  Once collected, the money was to remain in the custody of the mayor, as had been the case in the initial levy of the benevolence, until the king or his council sent for it (BL, Harl MS 543, fos 148v-149).There are other indications that the projected timescale did not hold good; the latest recorded payment of the benevolence in John Elrington\'s account was on 29 December 1475, and indeed no payments from the receivers to Elrington are recorded in his account as having been made before 23 May 1475.  Elrington\'s enrolled account, much of it illegible, records total receipts of the benevolence at £21,656.8s.3d.  Payments of the benevolence are also found on the teller\'s roll of Easter 1475 (E 405) and the receipt roll, as late as Michaelmas 1478 (E 401).  The bulk of the contributions came from the southeastern counties; nothing was received from the northern counties.  Perhaps, as in 1481, they contributed men rather than money.(Gray, \'The First Benevolence\', pp 90-113; C.L. Kingsford, |Chronicles of London| (Oxford, 1905), p 186; |The Great Chronicle of London|, ed. A.H. and I.D. Thornley (London, 1938), p. 223; R. Virgoe, \'The Benevolence of 1481\', |EHR|, CIV (1989), 28; Harriss, \'Aids, Loans and Benevolences\', 8-13; Ross, |Edward IV|, p 217)enrolled account: E 361/7, rot. 36d (printed and analysed in Gray, \'The First Benevolence\', pp 96-97) ",Origin  Imposed,"1st: 1475 Jan 1 - Feb 1, 2nd: 1475 May 1 - 12"
481,1481 Feb ,benevolence ,Edward IV ,"It was probably in his great council of November 1480 that Edward IV decided to seek a \'benevolence\' of his subjects in order to finance the campaign against the Scots, which had also been agreed at that council.  In February 1481 he sent letters under his signet to the English towns and counties requesting money, justifying the necessity of the campaign by describing the treachery and aggression of the Scots.The letter sent to the city of Coventry was dated 28 February and is copied into the Coventry Leet Book.  It asked the city for financial assistance, and negotiations followed between the city and the commissioners until the sum of £200 was agreed upon.  It was later decided, however, that the city would instead provide men for the campaign, and that the Prince of Wales would raise the contribution for the city (Coventry being part of the prince\'s Duchy of Cornwall).  A similar letter sent to Salisbury was also copied into the city\'s ledger.  There the commissioners informed the citizens that they would acquit themselves of the responsibility of bearing arms by contributing, and the sum of £100 was negotiated.In Norwich, the proceedings recorded in the city\'s assembly book shed light on the way in which the negotiations for the benevolence were conducted.  A \'general assembly\' was held on 30 March at which the king\'s letter was read in the presence of the commissioners, who added that no one who was worth more than 20 marks was to be excused from contributing, \'unlesss he were retained personally to fight for the king\'.  The commissioners then ordered the mayor and sheriffs to certify the names of all liable persons.  After these demands had been heard, it was suggested to the assembly that the mayor and certain citizens should negotiate with the commissioners for the payment of a lump sum, as had occurred in Salisbury and Coventry.  It was agreed that two persons from each parish would assess their parish and the sum negotiated with the commissioners was £200, which was to be paid within 20 days.  At Lynn and Canterbury, similar procedures were followed, but in York the city was asked to supply men for the campaign - a figure of 140 men being agreed upon.  The London common council met on 12 February and decided to contribute 5,000 marks.The payment of the benevolence is recorded on the Exchequer teller\'s rolls and from these it can be seen that substantial individuals were approached for contributions (see, for example, E 405/69, rot. 4d; E 405/566, rots. 4d, 9d).  The instructions to the commissioners appointed to levy the benevolence in the countryside survive among the proceedings of the privy council, although they were mis-dated to 1436 or 1442 in the printed proceedings (BL, Cotton MS Cleo. F.VI, fo 244).  The commissioners were told to summon before them all the inhabitants over the age of 16 years, read the king\'s letter to them, and point out to each that the king had the right to compel them to fight if they would not contribute.  The names of all the inhabitants were to be entered in two books, together with the sums promised.  Those still reluctant to pay were to be reminded that they would \'spend less than they would in two days if summoned to go in their own persons\'.  Anyone who had not appeared was to be visited by two persons appointed for the task, who would also act as collectors.  One of the books was to remain with the commissioners and the other was to be sent to the council at London.  The money was to be delivered \'in all haste\' to the council.  Only two such books, both for the county of Norfolk, appear to survive (DL 28/27/12, and E 179/242/28).It is evident also, that, as in 1474-5, those men called to appear before the commissioners were compelled to enter into bonds with the king, guaranteeing payment of the benevolence.  One such bond was that given by William Culpeper and 11 other men of Larkfield hundred in Kent on 16 April 1481, in which they promised to contribute £40 in a month\'s time (Surrey Record Office, Guildford, LM 1529).The bulk of the money from the benevolence was paid into the receipt of the Exchequer and paid out again by the tellers on warrant from the king and council.  It is the teller\'s rolls, rather than the receipt rolls, however, which record payment of the benevolence.  The rolls for Easter term 1481 and Michaelmas term 1481-2 are missing, but those for the preceding term (October 1480-April 1481) and the subsequent term (April-September 1482) contain many references.  A rough book kept by the teller Richard Boteler also records payments (E 405/69, rot. 2; E 405/70, rots. 1, 5; E 405/566).  The one surviving membrane of the roll of the teller John Fitzherbert for Michaelmas term 1480 also contains benevolence entries, showing receipts from Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, Huntingdon., Dorset, Northamptonshire and Norfolk.Later teller\'s rolls record benevolence payments also, as money continued to come in, in dribs and drabs (see especially the roll for Easter term 1482), and payments were made as late as Michaelmas 1484 (E 405/70-3).  No receipts have been recorded from the counties of Devon, Cornwall, Warwickshire, Leicestershire, Oxfordshire and Rutland, and the northern counties contributed men rather than money.  Dr. Virgoe notes that in Norfolk no woman contributed, \'perhaps owing to the nature of the levy as commuted military service\'.   It is difficult to calculate total receipts for a number of reasons, one of which is that it is difficult to tell actual receipts from obligations, but he estimated that the final total may have been as much as £30,000.Resentment to the imposition of the benevolence can be presumed, as in the parliament of 1484 an act was passed banning benevolences, and public feeling was strong enough to prevent Richard III from breaching its provisions.(Virgoe, \'Benevolence of 1481\', 25-45; |POPC|, V, pp 418-21) ",Origin  Imposed,1st: 1481 April
582,1472 Nov 30 ,"subsidy to raise 13,000 archers (income tax of 10%) ",Edward IV ,"Parliament opened on 6 October 1472, and having received a written declaration from the king of the danger in which his kingdom stood, and his intention to mount a French expedition, the commons agreed on 30 November 1472 to grant him the money to raise an army of 13,000 archers for the defence of the realm.  This grant harkened back to an earlier grant of the cost of 13,000 archers made to Henry VI at the Reading parliament in 1453, but never levied.  The army was to be assembled for a year and would receive 6d. per day in wages.  To meet the costs of this army, which totalled £118,625, the commons would pay a subsidy of one tenth of the issues and profits of the lands, tenements, rents, fees, annuities, offices, corrodies and pensions of all temporal possessions.  The lords made an identical grant under the same conditions, a contemporary copy of which survives (BL, Cotton MS Cleo. F.VI, fo 212).  The taxable year was to begin on the feast of the Circumcision (1 January 1473) and the tax was payable on 2 February 1473.Commissioners were to be appointed in the same manner as they were customarily appointed to levy fifteenths and tenths, and were to \'to serche, enquere and take knowelech by all maner weyes and meanes after their discretion possible\' of the values of all lands, tenements, etc., within their remit.  An original commission for the assessment of the borough of Ludlow, dated 5 December 1472, makes clear that the commissioners could avail themselves of the services of sheriffs, mayors, bailiffs, constables or other officials in the execution of their commission (BL, Cotton MS Cleo. F.VI, fo 211).Although the total sum of £118,625, needed for the cost of the archers, was not apportioned among the counties in the record of the grant on the parliament roll, it is evident that such an apportionment was made, and that schedules of these apportioned sums, as well as the number of archers to be furnished by each county, were given to the commissioners.  Two copies of such schedules survive in the Surrey Record Office, Guildford (LM 1498A and 1498B).  The assessments made by the commissioners would have been carried out, therefore, with the overall county quota in mind.After the valuations had been made, the same commissioners were to appoint collectors of the tenth and prepare indentures for them, listing the sums and names of the persons from whom they were to collect them, which would act as their warrants to make the collection.  Collectors were empowered to distrain and sell the lands and/or goods of those who defaulted on payment.  Those whose assets were not distrainable, either because no distrainable goods could be found, or because the assessed income was in the form of offices or annuities, and who had not made payment within fifteen days of the payment date, were to pay double the amount assessed, and were liable to Exchequer process against them to obtain payment.  The collectors were to certify the details of the defaulters into the Exchequer and were to be thereafter discharged from responsibility for the sums in their accounts.  Process would be issued against the defaulters in the Exchequer, with the execution of that process put into the hands of the sheriffs.  Any negligent or defaulting collectors would also be liable to proceedings against them by the Exchequer, and would be imprisoned until they made fine for the amount owed.All the money collected, as well as that gathered in by the sheriffs by distress, was to be paid to the commissioners and held in secure places (in castles, towns or religious houses) within the jurisdictional bounds of those commissioners, by indentures made between the commissioners and keepers of such places.  In the grant made by the lords, the money was to be delivered into the custody of certain named lords at St. Paul\'s Cathedral and kept by them there.  The money was not to be brought to the Exchequer or paid to the king, except by the direction of the commons, who were to be notified by certificate of all sums collected.  It was to be held in the counties until it had been ascertained that it was actually needed, in other words, if the planned expedition was indeed mounted.  If the campaign was not underway by Michaelmas 1474, then the grant would be cancelled and the money returned to those from whom it had been collected.It was a further condition of the grant that the information obtained by the commissioners during the process of assessment was to be for their own instruction only, and was never to be returned into any of the king\'s \'courtes of recorde\', nor to be a matter of record in any such court.  Members of the commons were exempt from appointment as collectors.  The commons were not to be charged with finding archers to replace those who died or left the king\'s service, and the king was to remit any claim he had to a grant of 13,000 archers made in the parliament held at Reading in 31 Henry VI, and to a fifteenth and tenth granted in 1468 of which part remained unpaid.  The possessions of the queen were to be exempt from this tax.No assessments are known to exist among the E 179 documents, but that of the town of Nottingham, dated 20 January 1473, is among that town\'s archives and has been printed in |Records of the Borough of Nottingham|, 5 vols. (London, 1883), II, pp 285-296.  Two other assessments (of the hundreds of Badbury and Rowbarrow in Dorset are in the Dorset Record Office, Dorchester (D/WLC/X3), both of which are still attached to indentures appointing collectors and instructing them to deliver the money to the abbot of Sherborne.  A copy of the assessment of the wapentake of Claro in the North Riding of Yorkshire, is now Bodl., Dodsworth MS 50, fos. 39-79); this assessment was previously thought to have been for the 1489 income tax, but internal evidence proves it to be an assessment for this tax.  Money paid into the Exchequer and appearing on the teller\'s roll for Michaelmas 1472-Hilary 1473 amounted to £2,461.3s.4d.  On 30 November 1472 parliament was prorogued until 8 February 1473.  On the last day of that second session, 8 April 1473, it was reported that the returns from the subsidy had not yet been received from all the counties, and the total amount to be expected was still unknown.  A further fifteenth and tenth was granted, therefore, under much the same conditions imposed in the grant of the subsidy.On 18 July 1474, at a later session of the same parliament, it was announced that the subsidy had yielded a total of £31,410 14s.1&#189;d., although returns were lacking from Cheshire, Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmorland, Durham, the town of Newcastle, the city of Lincoln, the wapentake of Ewecrosse, Yorkshire and the hundred of Wormelowe, Herefordshire.  Arrangements to make up the shortfall were agreed by another indenture between the king and commons on that date, but much of this was never collected.  As far as is known, the £31,410 14s.1&#189;d. reported in parliament is the total amount received by the levy of the income tax of 10%.  No accounts of the tax are known to exist.(|Rot. Parl|., V, pp 231-233; VI, pp 4-8, 39-41, 113-121; Steel, |Receipt of the Exchequer|, pp 300-301; H.L. Gray, \'The First Benevolence\' in |Facts and Factors in Economic History|, ed. A.H.

628,1474 July 18 ,"subsidy of £5,383 15s. from the northern counties ",Edward IV ,"Another session of the prorogued parliament began on 6 June 1474, and on 18 July 1474, the last day of the session before parliament was again prorogued, arrangements were made to compensate for the shortfall in the subsidy granted to the king in 1472 to maintain 13,000 archers for a year, after it was announced that the collection of that subsidy had yielded a total of only £31,410 14s.1&#189;d.  This yield had fallen far short of the £118,625 required to pay the wages of the archers.The shortfall was to be made up by the levy of two separate taxes - a fifteenth and tenth, and a charge on the areas (mostly in the north) which had made no return in 1472 for the cost of 590 archers, in lieu of the contribution of those areas for the 1472 income tax.  The number of archers to be charged on each locality was prescribed by parliament and the total amount expected from them was £5,383 15s.  The proportions assigned to each were: Cheshire (60 archers), Northumberland (60 archers), Cumberland (72 archers), Westmorland (56 archers) and Durham (300 archers), the town of Newcastle (10 archers), the city of Lincoln (10 archers), the wapentake of Ewecrosse, Yorkshire (10 archers) and the hundred of Wormelowe, Herefordshire (10 archers).  (This adds up to only 588 archers, however.)  Their liability for the 1472 income tax was to cease; they were also to be excused from payment of the fifteenth and tenth, and any further assessment which might be required to find the wages of the 13,000 archers.(|Rot.

629,1474 July 18 ,"subsidy of shortfall of £51,147 4s.7 3/4d for 13,000 archers ",Edward IV ,"On 18 July 1474, the last day of the session of the parliament which had begun on 6 June 1474, further arrangements were made to compensate for the £51,147 4s.7&#190;d. still lacking from the original grant for the 13,000 archers.  This money was to be found by the counties and towns which had already paid the 1472 income tax and were about to pay a fifteenth and tenth.  The method devised for levying this sum was something of a hybrid between the 1472 subsidy of a tenth on income and the traditional payment of a fifteenth and tenth.The tax was to be paid primarily by those persons who had little or no land, and thus did not contribute heavily to the 1472 income tax, and whose goods and chattels were \'litell or not charged\' in the standard levy of a fifteenth and tenth.  Normal contributors to the fifteenth and tenth were to be charged as well, but relatively less than usual.  Those who had paid the 1472 income tax were to bear the lightest burden.  Also to be charged were the lands and other possessions of the order of St. John of Jerusalem (the property of the prior excepted).  Payment was to be made in two equal instalments - the first on 24 June 1475 and the second on 11 November 1475.  The grant, again agreed by indenture between the king and commons, was, of course, also subject to the condition that the king leave for France by 24 June 1476.  Everything that had been collected was to be returned to the taxpayers if the condition were not fulfilled.The total sum of £51,147 4s.7&#190;d. was apportioned between all the counties and cities of England - the amounts due from each were determined by the commons and listed on the parliament roll.  Commissioners for the levy were to be appointed, and they were to be given full authority to further apportion the sums among the cities, towns and hamlets within their jurisdiction.  Their apportionments were to be based on enquiries and examinations, and in accordance with the principles established in the grant for the distribution of the tax burden, as outlined above.  The commissioners were to appoint collectors, who were given the power to distrain and sell the goods of defaulters after 15 days, and to instigate Exchequer proceedings against those with no distrainable goods for the seizure of their lands.  Defaulting collectors were punishable by imprisonment.  Like the levy of the income tax in 1472-3, and the fifteenth and tenth granted in 1473 and re-granted in 1474, the collectors were not to pay the money collected into the Exchequer, but to put it in local repositories for safekeeping until the order for army musters was given.On 14 March 1475, the tax was converted into one and three-quarters fifteenths and tenths.(|Rot. Parl|., VI, pp 113-121, 150-153; Gray, \'The First Benevolence\', pp 102-106) ",Origin  Granted,"1st: 1475 June 24, 2nd: 1475 Nov 11"
630,1475 Jan 23 x March 14 ,one and three-quarters fifteenths and tenths ,Edward IV ,"At the session which ended on 18 July 1474, parliament was prorogued again until 23 January 1475.  Some time during this subsequent session, probably on the last day, 14 March 1475, another indenture was drawn up altering the arrangements for the levy of the shortfall tax of £51,147 4s.7&#190;d.  Preparations for war were busily underway, and it had become apparent that there was an inadequate amount of time to assess and collect this levy, the form of which was described as \'diffuse and laborious\'.  The chancellor, moreover, declared that the king was in need of the money immediately and could not wait until the first payment came due on 24 June 1475.Since the \'moost easy, redy and prone payment of any charge\' was the traditional fifteenth and tenth, the commons therefore converted both payments of the £51,147 4s.7&#190;d. into a fifteenth and tenth payable at the quinzaine of Easter (9 April), and another three-quarters of a fifteenth and tenth to be paid at Martinmas (11 November).  The roll also recorded that much of the money which had been collected thus far in the levy of the subsidy was still held in the possession of the designated repositories, the collectors, or the commissioners, some of which had been spent, and that there was considerable reluctance to hand it over.  Nevertheless, with the expedition soon to take place, the remaining funds were released to the king. Edward IV finally embarked on his voyage to France on 4 July 1475, but the campaign proved a dismal failure.  Having been let down by his Burgundian allies, Edward IV instead made peace with the French, and on 29 August signed the Treaty of Picquigny.  A month later he returned to England and, as a political gesture, he remitted the three-quarters of a fifteenth and tenth which had not yet been collected on 6 October 1475.In 1480, however, when war with Scotland was in the offing, the grant of the three-quarters was \'reactivated\'.  The Norwich Assembly Proceedings 1434-91 and the \'Hall Book\' of the King\'s Lynn Archives (both now in the Norfolk Record Office) record that the tax was being collected in both towns by early January 1481, and it is apparent from the teller\'s roll for Easter 1481 that money was reaching the Exchequer by April (E 405/69).  From a roll of receipts of the tax, drawn up at the Exchequer (now BL, Harl Roll E.12), Dr. Virgoe was able to determine that over £20,000 was eventually received.  It is also evident from this roll that Yorkshire, Lancashire and the four northern shires were not called upon to pay.(|Rot.

They were to bring the money to the city of York on 5 May and pay it to whomever was appointed to receive it.  On 30 April the arrangements were altered; the money was to be paid to an appointed receiver at the Exchequer of Receipt before 8 May, whence it would be delivered to the king.  In exchange for his contribution, the taxpayer would receive an indented bill by which he would be discharged from payment.No records relating to this tax are known to exist.(|CCR 1461-1468|, pp 230, 259) ",Origin  Imposed,1st: 1464 May 8
821,1462 March 23 ,half a clerical tenth from York province ,Edward IV ,"In response to Henry VI\'s writ of 12 February 1460, the clergy of the province of York met in convocation at York on 30 April 1460.  After various adjournments caused by the political crisis, the clergy re-assembled, and on 23 March 1462, following \'many discussions with the archbishop who, personally in his provincial council, with all possible diligence exhorted them to make a grant of a subsidy\' to Edward IV, they voted him a subsidy of half a tenth from all ecclesiastical benefices assessed and accustomed to pay the tenth.  The tax was said to have been granted unanimously \'from the warmth of the affection by which they are led to perform the king\'s will and from their desire to show themselves to be the king\'s well-wishers and faithful lieges\', and was expressly for the defence of the Scottish marshes and to support the king\'s other charges (|CFR 1461-1471|, p 89).It was granted on condition that: (a) neither the clergy nor their farmers be obliged to pay fifteenths with the laity, or any other secular contribution, on the goods and possessions for which they normally paid clerical tenths, and if any attempt was made to levy a lay tax on them, then they and their farmers would be excused payment of the tenth and in no way bound to pay it at all; and (b) that the tax not be collected before the specified dates.Wholly excused from payment of the half a tenth were: (a) the monasteries of Drax, Ferriby, Watton, St. Michael, Hull, Holy Trinity, York, and Ellerton (in Yorkshire), and Mattersay, Felley, Rufford, Blyth and Shelford (in Nottinghamshire), and their goods, benefices and possessions; (b) all monasteries of poor nuns and their goods, benefices and possessions, because of their notorious poverty, to be certified by the relevant bishop or ordinary; (c) the commons of the chapel of St. Mary and the Holy Angels (a chapel adjoining the north side of the nave of York Minster, also known as St. Sepulchre\'s), York and the cathedral church of York (i.e., York Minster), the parish church of Sturton (in Lincolnshire), the common of the collegiate church of St John of Beverley (i.e. Beverley Minster), and the churches of Misterton (in Nottinghamshire), Topcliffe and Brodsworth (both in Yorkshire), which are all appropriated to York Minster for the completion of the repair of its fabric; and (d) the churches of Ferry Fryston (with its portion), Huntington and Barnbrough (in Yorkshire), a moiety of the church of Treswell (in Nottinghamshire), the church of Little Markham (in Nottinghamshire), the prebends of North Leverton in Southwell Minster, Pelton and Lumley in the collegiate church of Chester le Street, and Escomb in the collegiate church of Auckland (in Durham), and the church of Washington (in Durham), because of their excessive assessment; (e) the lands and possessions of the abbey of Meaux (in Yorkshire), which have been destroyed by the waters of the sea and rivers; (f) all priories, monasteries and benefices in Cumberland, Copeland (in Cumberland), Westmorland and Northumberland, and the temporalities and spiritualities annexed to them; and (g) all benefices with cure of souls, assessed by the |Nova Taxatio| or old assessment (i.e., the |Taxatio| of 1291) at 10 marks or less, in regard to which, if the assessment is in doubt, the collectors shall not be charged unless it is first found by inquisition of the bishop or ordinary that the benefice in question has been assessed at a greater sum, so that neither the bishops or ordinaries, nor the collectors, nor the occupants of the benefices be vexed or grieved in any way by the king\'s officers.Receiving exemption from one half of the levy, and paying thus only one quarter of a tenth, were: (a) the monasteries of Thurgarton, Newstead and Welbeck (in Nottinghamshire), Marton, Monkbretton, Roche, Pontefract, Bolton in Craven, Haltemprice and Egglestone (in Yorkshire), and Cockersand (in Lancashire), and all their goods, benefices and possessions in the province; (b) the churches of Kilvington, Babworth and Leake (in Nottinghamshire), Kirkham (in Lancashire), and Hinderwell, South Dalton and Kirby Wiske (in Yorkshire); and (c) the prebends of Langtoft in York Minster, East Stoke (Stoke by Newark) and Edingley in Southwell Minster, and Saltmarsh in the collegiate church of Howden, and the temporalities of the provost of the collegiate church of Beverley and the parish church of Welwick (in Yorkshire), which is appropriated to the said provostry, because of the \'dreadful and unwonted storms of the sea and the Humber\', and their excessive assessment.  Commissions for collection were issued on 16 October 1462, and the names of the collectors were to be certified to the Exchequer by 14 January 1463.

By 12 August, when the archbishop certified the king of the grant, a tax of a tenth of all ecclesiastical goods, benefices and possessions, assessed and accustomed to pay the tenth, had been voted.  The clergy were said to have granted the tax unanimously after many discussions with the archbishop, \'from the warmth of the affection by which they are led to perform the king\'s will and from their desire to show themselves to be the king\'s well-wishers and faithful lieges...especially for the defence of the marches of England towards Scotland, and to support the king\'s other charges\' (|CFR 1461-1471|, p 135).The tax was granted on condition that: (a) neither the clergy nor their farmers be obliged to pay fifteenths with the laity, or any other secular contribution, on the goods and possessions for which they normally paid clerical tenths, and if any attempt was made to levy a lay tax on them, then they and their farmers would be excused payment of the tenth and in no way bound to pay it at all; and (b) that the tax not be collected before the specified dates.Wholly excused from payment of the tenth were: (a) the monasteries of Drax, Ferriby, Watton, St. Michael, Hull, Holy Trinity, York, and Ellerton (in Yorkshire), and Mattersay, Felley, Rufford, Blyth and Shelford (in Nottinghamshire), and their goods, benefices and possessions; (b) all monasteries of poor nuns and their goods, benefices and possessions, because of their notorious poverty, to be certified by the relevant bishop or ordinary; (c) the commons of the chapel of St. Mary and the Holy Angels (a chapel adjoining the north side of the nave of York Minster, also known as St. Sepulchre\'s), York and the cathedral church of York (i.e., York Minster), the parish church of Sturton (in Lincolnshire), the common of the collegiate church of St John of Beverley (i.e. Beverley Minster), and the churches of Misterton (in Nottinghamshire), Topcliffe and Brodsworth (both in Yorkshire), which are all appropriated to York Minster for the completion of the repair of its fabric; and (d) the churches of Ferry Fryston (with its portion), Huntington and Barnbrough (in Yorkshire), a moiety of the church of Treswell (in Nottinghamshire), the churches of Radcliffe upon Soar, Barnby in the Willows and Screveton (in Nottinghamshire), the prebend of North Leverton in Southwell Minster (in Nottinghamshire), and the church of Washington (in Durham), because of their excessive assessment; (e) the lands and possessions of the abbey of Meaux (in Yorkshire), which have been destroyed by the waters of the sea and rivers; (f) all priories, monasteries and benefices in Cumberland, Copeland (in Cumberland), Westmorland and Northumberland, and the temporalities and spiritualities annexed to them; (g) all benefices with cure of souls, assessed by the |Nova Taxatio| or old assessment (i.e., the |Taxatio| of 1291) at 10 marks or less; and (h) the priory of St Andrew, York, on account of its notorious poverty, in regard to which, if the assessment is in doubt, the collectors shall not be charged unless it is first found by inquisition of the bishop or ordinary that the benefice in question has been assessed at a greater sum, so that neither the bishops or ordinaries, nor the collectors, nor the occupants of the benefices be vexed or grieved in any way by the king\'s officers.Receiving exemption from one half of the levy, and paying thus only a half a tenth, were: (a) the monasteries of Lenton, Thurgarton, Newstead and Welbeck (in Nottinghamshire), Marton, Monkbretton, Roche, Kirkstall, Pontefract, Selby, Bolton in Craven, Haltemprice, Coverham, Warter, St. Robert, Knaresborough, Kirkham and Egglestone (in Yorkshire), and Cockersand (in Lancashire), and all their goods, benefices and possessions in the province; (b) the churches of Kilvington (in Nottinghamshire), Kirkham (in Lancashire), and Hinderwell, South Dalton and Leven (in Yorkshire); and (c) the prebends of Langtoft in York Minster, Edingley in Southwell Minster, Escomb in the collegiate church of Auckland (in Durham), and Saltmarsh in the collegiate church of Howden, and the temporalities of the provost of the collegiate church of Beverley and the parish church of Welwick (in Yorkshire), which is appropriated to the said provostry, because of the \'dreadful and unwonted storms of the sea and the Humber, and the diminution of their fruits and provents\' (|CFR 1461-1471|, p 137).

Before dispersing, they voted two tenths of all ecclesiastical benefices, assessed according to the |Nova Taxatio| (or the old, that is, the |Taxatio| of 1291, where no new assessment was made), and accustomed to pay the tenth.The tax was granted on condition that: (a) neither the clergy nor their farmers be obliged to pay fifteenths with the laity, or any other secular contribution, on the goods and possessions for which they normally paid clerical tenths, and if any attempt was made to levy a lay tax on them, then they and their farmers would be excused payment of the tenth and in no way bound to pay it; and (b) that the tax not be collected before the specified dates.Wholly excused from payment of the two tenths were: (a) the monasteries of Drax, Ferriby, Watton, St. Michael, Hull, Holy Trinity, York, and Ellerton (in Yorkshire), and Mattersay, Felley, Rufford, Blyth and Shelford (in Nottinghamshire), and their goods, benefices and possessions; (b) all monasteries of poor nuns and their goods, benefices and possessions, because of their notorious poverty, to be certified by the relevant bishop or ordinary; (c) the commons of the chapel of St. Mary and the Holy Angels (a chapel adjoining the north side of the nave of York Minster, also known as St. Sepulchre\'s), York and the cathedral church of York (i.e., York Minster), the parish church of Sturton (in Lincolnshire), the common of the collegiate church of St John of Beverley (i.e. Beverley Minster), and the churches of Misterton (in Nottinghamshire), Topcliffe and Brodsworth (both in Yorkshire), which are all appropriated to York Minster for the completion of the repair of its fabric; and (d) the churches of Ferry Fryston (with its portion), Huntington and Barnbrough (in Yorkshire), a moiety of the church of Treswell (in Nottinghamshire), the churches of Barnby in the Willows, Screveton and Radcliff upon Soar (in Nottinghamshire), the prebend of North Leverton in Southwell Minster (in Nottinghamshire), and the church of Washington (in Durham), because of their excessive assessment; (e) the lands and possessions of the abbey of Meaux (in Yorkshire), which have been destroyed by the waters of the sea and rivers; (f) all priories, monasteries and benefices in Cumberland, Copeland (in Cumberland), Westmorland and Northumberland, and the temporalities and spiritualities annexed to them; (g) all benefices with cure of souls, assessed by the |Nova Taxatio| or old assessment (i.e., the |Taxatio| of 1291) at 10 marks or less; and (h) the priory of St Andrew, York, on account of its notorious poverty, in regard to which, if the assessment is in doubt, the collectors shall not be charged unless it is first found by inquisition of the bishop or ordinary that the benefice in question has been assessed at a greater sum, so that neither the bishops or ordinaries, nor the collectors, nor the occupants of the benefices be vexed or grieved in any way by the king\'s officers.Receiving exemption from one half of the levy, and paying thus only a tenth (in four payments of one-quarter), were: (a) the monasteries of Lenton, Thurgarton, Newstead and Welbeck (in Nottinghamshire), Marton, Monkbretton, Roche, Kirkstall, Pontefract, Selby, Bolton in Craven, Haltemprice, Coverham, Warter, St. Robert, Knaresborough, Kirkham and Egglestone (in Yorkshire), and Cockersand (in Lancashire), and all their goods, benefices and possessions in the province; (b) the churches of Kilvington (in Nottinghamshire), Kirkham (in Lancashire), and Hinderwell, Foxholes and Huggate (in Yorkshire), because of their excessive assessment and impoverishment; (c) the churches of Leake (in Nottinghamshire), Easington, South Dalton and Leven (in Yorkshire), the prebends of Langtoft in York Minster, East Stoke (Stoke by Newark), South Scarle and Edingley in Southwell Minster, and Saltmarsh in the collegiate church of Howden, the provostry of the collegiate church of St. Mary, Hemingbrough (in Yorkshire), and the temporalities of the provost of the collegiate church of Beverley and the parish church of Welwick (in Yorkshire), which is appropriated to the said provostry.

850,1481 April 12 ,clerical tenth from Canterbury province ,Edward IV ,"In response to a royal writ of 1 February 1481, the clergy of the province of Canterbury assembled in convocation in the chapter house at St. Paul\'s, London, on 21 March 1481.  On 28 March, after the clergy had sat for a week, councillors sent by the king - namely, Richard, duke of Gloucester, the Marquis of Dorset, the earl of Northumberland, Earl Rivers, Lord Stanley and John Woode, sub-treasurer of England and \'very many others\' - entered the chapter house.  The sub-treasurer made a speech in English in which he asked the clergy for a notable subsidy.  After a discussion, it was decided that the bishops would repair to the Tower to discuss the subsidy personally with the king.  On 3 April, the elected speaker, William Pykenham, archdeacon of Suffolk, exhibited four schedules in the chapter house, one of which gave details of the proposed subsidy.  These schedules were discussed at length from 9 to 12 April, and on the latter date, the terms of the proposed tax grant were accepted by the bishops and prelates and ratified by the archbishop, after amendment.  Convocation was dismissed on 16 April.The following subsidies were granted: a tenth of all ecclesiastical goods, benefices and possessions, assessed and accustomed to pay the tenth, a tenth of all ecclesiastical goods, benefices and possessions which were not assessed, and a tenth of all ecclesiastical goods, benefices and possessions of alien priories, whether in the hands of clerics or laymen.  These grants were made on condition: (a) that once the bishop or ordinary of any diocese has appointed someone as collector of the tenth and certified his name to the Exchequer, that he shall not be bound to appoint and certify another person as collector (i.e., in his place), any letters of discharge from collection, made by letters patent of the king, to any cleric of the province, notwithstanding; (b) that if any collector appointed to levy the tenth certifies the Exchequer, on his oath, that from the time that the grant was made up to the date upon which the last payment is due he has been unable to collect, or has been prevented from collecting this tax, or any part of it, that collector will be wholly discharged from making that collection and be quit at the Exchequer, and it will be left to the king and his ministers to collect it; (c) that no persons in the lower house of the convocation which granted the tenth will be appointed to collect it; and (d) that, except for the tenth agreed to be paid in advance (see below), the tenth will not be collected before the specified payment dates.Excused wholly from payment were:(a) the goods, benefices and possessions of all poor religious (i.e. monks and canons), nuns (and canonesses), and other pious places of the province, and the goods, possessions and benefices of all religious and other ecclesiastics within the province, whose monasteries, priories, places, goods, possessions or benefices have been (or from the day of the grant of the said tenth up to the time of the last payment of the same shall be) destroyed, much impoverished or excessively diminished by floods, fires, ruin, wars or other accidents, or in any other way, to be certified by the relevant bishop or ordinary, from time to time up to the last day of payment;(b) all ecclesiastical benefices that, on account of their poverty, are unofficed, to be certified by the relevant bishop or ordinary;(c) unappropriated ecclesiastical benefices with cure of souls, whether assessed or not assessed, and not accustomed to pay the tenth, the true value of which are 12 marks per annum or less, in which the rectors or vicars, or others by whatsoever name they be known, have resided and do reside continuously in person, to be certified by the relevant bishop or ordinary, or if absent from the same, effectively pursue the study of letters at one of the universities of the realm, having been sufficiently licensed for it, upon which the relevant bishop is to certify the Exchequer, and such certificates are to be wholly accepted without any other inquisition, investigation or delay;(d) the ecclesiastical goods, possessions and benefices of all colleges or collegiate halls in the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, Eton College (in Buckinghamshire), and Winchester College (in Winchester);(e) the benefices, goods and possessions of all rectors, vicars and other beneficed clergy who, after [2]6 June 1478 (the last day of the last convocation) and before the date of the grant, and up to the time of the last payment of the tenth, shall have been indicted, accused or imprisoned by lay persons or by the lay power for any felony or trespass or on any other charge, on the certification of the relevant bishop or ordinary;(f) the goods, benefices and possessions of Syon Abbey (in Middlesex), the priory of Sheen (in Surrey), the London Charterhouse and all other Carthusian houses in the province; and(g) the prebends of Corringham and North Kelsey in the cathedral church of Lincoln, and the parish church of Leverington (in Cambridgeshire), whereof the fruits and provents have so far decreased that they are insufficient to support the tenth assessed of old, and the charges incumbent on the same (nevertheless the prelates and clergy willed that a tenth be paid from the same, of the prebend of Corringham after the value of 40 marks, of the parish church of Leverington after the value of 50 marks, and of the prebend of North Kelsey after the value of 20 marks).In addition to these grants, the clergy agreed that all bishops, abbots, priors, prelates and other ecclesiastics of the province, due to pay the tenth, who held or possessed certain specified ecclesiastical goods, benefices and possessions (evidently identified as valuable), would pay the whole tax on these possessions in one payment, in advance of the rest of the clergy, on 31 May 1481.

937,1464 June 26 or earlier - 1465 May 13 or later ,\'gratuitous\' clerical subsidy for Turkish crusade ,Edward IV ,"Ever since the fall of Constantinople and proclamation of a crusade by Pope Nicholas V, on 30 September 1453, successive popes had been unsuccessfully seeking to impose a papal levy in England for the purpose of raising the necessary funds.  When it was announced to Edward IV that Pope Pius II had undertaken to lead the crusade in person, he was moved to convince the English clergy to contribute to this cause, but did not wish to allow the precedent of a levy by papal imposition.On 17 May 1464 the king wrote to the archbishops of Canterbury and York explaining that he wished to prevent the pope from attempting to impose a levy for the crusade by offering him a notable gift, which would be considerably smaller than the sum which would otherwise be imposed by the pope.  He therefore asked the archbishops to require the bishops of all the dioceses to assemble their clergy for the purpose of granting him a subsidy, which would be levied quickly and in time for the proposed expedition in July, and forwarded by the king\'s receivers to the pope.  The tax would be paid not to the Exchequer, but to six receivers appointed by the king (three clerics and three laymen drawn from the king\'s council), to whom the collectors in each diocese would deliver their receipts and before whom they would account.Although the king had directed the archbishops to procure the grant of a subsidy of at least 8d. or 12d. in the pound, the archbishop of Canterbury asked for only 6d. in the pound, or a fortieth (one-quarter of a tenth) and most dioceses eventually granted this sum.  Most assemblies in the province were held late in June or during July (the first known to have met being Bath and Wells on 26 June), but the clergy of the diocese of Ely did not make their grant until 13 May 1465.  Some dioceses granted only 4d. in the pound initially, but the king demanded an additional 2d. in the pound from the clergy of these dioceses and forced them to meet again to grant the necessary sum.  In the province of York the same procedure was followed; the diocese of York met on 13 July and granted the so-called \'gratuitous subsidy\'.Individual features of the levy varied from diocese to diocese.  In the diocese of Salisbury, the prelates granted 6d. in the pound and the rectors and vicars only 4d. in the pound.  Most of the grants specified that the tax was to be paid by both those normally assessed to pay the tenth and those not assessed to pay the tenth.  In the dioceses of Canterbury and Salisbury, there was a threshold of liability of £8, and in Worcester this level was set at £10.  The goods and benefices of the Oxford and Cambridge colleges and of poor religious and nuns were sometimes exempt, as were a number of other benefices, sometimes for unspecified reasons, but stated to be those customarily exempt from the payment of tenths to the king.  The list of exempt benefices in the diocese of Winchester included 127 benefices.The date for payment of 28 May, suggested by the archbishop of Canterbury, was generally, but not universally, accepted.  In the diocese of Canterbury payment was not required until 8 September and in those of Ely and Rochester the subsidy was not paid until 1465.  The collectors appointed by the bishops were archdeacons or abbots or priors, who were given power to enforce payment by ecclesiastical censures.Whether the money collected ever reached the papacy is not certain.  Pope Pius II died on 14 August 1464 at Ancona, which was to have been the embarcation point for the crusade, and how much, if any of these funds had been paid over to him by then cannot be determined.  His successor Paul II claimed that there were outstanding arrears which were never received in a letter to Edward IV on 26 June 1469.  The money may have been retained by a merchant who had been authorised to convey it to the pope.(Lunt, |Financial Relations of the Papacy with England 1327-1534|, pp 140-150) ",Origin  Granted,1st: 1464 May 28 - Sep 8
250,1549 March 12 ,subsidy (\'relief\') ,Edward VI ,"Parliament opened on 4 November 1548.  On 12 March 1549 it granted what it termed a \'relief\' over three years.  In fact, the tax was similar to a subsidy, although initially it embraced a poll tax on sheep and a purchase tax on cloth (both described under separate heads) and never included a tax on income from land.  The relief proved difficult to assess, and in the following year, the tax on cloths and sheep was repealed and replaced by a further (fourth) year of the subsidy on goods, at the same rates. Individuals with moveable goods worth more than £10 were taxed on them at 12d. per pound if they were native-born and at double this rate if they were foreigners.  Aliens with moveable goods worth between 20s. and £10 were also assessed, paying 12d. in the pound.  Those aliens who did not qualify for assessment on moveable goods paid a poll tax of 8d. per head, apart from married women, soldiers and children under 12, who were not liable.The dates by which assessments were to have been completed were:  20 March 1549 for payment by 6 May 1549; 20 January 1550 for payment by 20 April 1550; 20 January 1551 for payment by 20 April 1551; 20 January 1552 for payment by 20 April 1552.However, since the Acts of Union of England and Wales (27 Henry VIII, c. 26 and 34 and 35 Henry VIII, c. 26) had specifically reserved the right to marcher lords, including the monarch as such, of levying customary payments known as a \'mise\' or payment on first entry into their possessions, special arrangements were now made for the administration of this and subsequent taxes in the areas concerned.  These were chiefly Wales (excluding Monmouthshire) and Cheshire, and where tenants of crown lands and others were contributing to the mise at this time, and provision was specifically made in the Act to delay payment towards the subsidy until 1 May next after payment of the final instalment of the mise.  Subsequent payments were to be made before 1 May annually and when the reliefs of sheep and cloth were repealed, the additional instalment was also to be paid before the same date in the fourth year of collection.  The date of the last payment of the mise was to be certified in the Exchequer by 11 November 1549 and the document at E 179/363/2 may represent one such certificate for Brecknockshire.  In this, the date of the final payment of the mise in the lordship of Brecon and hundred of Defynnog, for example, is given as 30 November 1549, after which point the inhabitants would contribute to the relief.  Other surviving documents for those areas of Wales concerned, such as E 179/263/35 Part 2 for Carmarthenshire, also reflect this delay.  Since payments towards the relief were delayed, this also caused payments towards subsequent taxes to be put back, and this and further payments towards mises caused by the accession of new monarchs in 1553 and 1558, created a backlog of payments which does not appear to have been fully settled until around the 1570s (see the grant notes for subsequent subsidies up to and including the subsidy of 1576).Letters patent commissioning the collection were issued on 26 March 1549, almost a week after the assessment period for the first payment should have commenced (E 179/190/234), and there are other indications that the payment date for the first payment may have been postponed.  The assessment of Southwark for the first payment cites the payment date as 20 May 1549 (E 179/185/241), while the assessment of Canterbury for the same payment, dated 4 October 1549, refers to payment being due by the following 1 November (E 179/126/328).  The certificate of assessment for the first payment of the tax in the town of Nottingham states that the money was to be paid on 6 May 1549 or within one month after that date (E179/159/177).  A similar document for part of Leicestershire (E 179/134/163) notes that, as they received the king\'s commission so late, the commissioners there were unable to execute the relief in time for certification and payment at the specified times. A book listing the tax commissioners and collectors for the first two payments, and various details of the sums due, is now at E 179/281/10, while a book containing the names of some of the collectors is at E 179/281/8. Also, a roll containing a form of writ and list of commissioners dated 4 May 1559 to collect all payments of the relief in Wales (excluding Monmouthshire) is at C 212/22/3.(|Stat.

The rates were:|Natives|£5-10               =     8d.£10-20             =    12d.£20 and more   =    16d.|Aliens|under £5          =      8d.£5-10              =    12d.£10-20            =    18d.£20 and more  =      2s.On lands, the minimum threshold of liability was 20s. per annum, on which the annual tax payable was 2s. per pound for natives, and 3s. per pound for aliens.  Fractions of pounds were to be rated proportionately.  Aliens who were not liable in either category had to pay a poll tax of 4d. in each year.The subsidy was to be assessed annually by 31 October and certified at the Exchequer by 28 November in both 1553 and 1554, with payment due on the following 14 February, in 1554 and 1555.Two provisos were annexed to the Act, regarding payment of the subsidy in Wales (excluding Monmouthshire) and Cheshire.  Similar to the previous subsidy (the \'relief\' of 1549), payments towards this subsidy were to be made in those places only after earlier collections had been completed.  Payments were to be made within one year of the last instalment of the relief, for the following two years.  The date of the final collection of the relief was to be certified in the Exchequer by 11 November 1553.On her accession in July 1553 Mary remitted this subsidy by letters patent given on 1 September 1553, but the grant of two fifteenths and tenths made to Edward VI in the same parliament remained in force and was levied.(|Stat.

622,1549 March 12 ,relief of sheep ,Edward VI ,"Parliament opened on 4 November 1548.  On 12 March 1549 the commons granted a \'relief\'.  This tax was composed of three elements: a subsidy on moveable goods, a purchase tax on cloth, and a poll tax on sheep.The relief of sheep was to be paid yearly for three years.  For the purposes of the tax, three categories of sheep were identified, each subject to a different rate of taxation, as follows: upon ewes kept for most of the year on enclosed marshes or pastures (that is, lands not common or used for tillage), 3d. a head; upon wethers and other shear-sheep kept on such land, 2d. a head; and upon every shear-sheep kept on commons or enclosed grounds not used for tillage, three-halfpence a head.  (A shear-sheep is defined in the act as any sheep aged one year or over, whether it has been shorn or not.)  Those persons with 10 sheep or fewer were to pay a half penny for each of them, while those having between 10 and 20 sheep would pay 1d. a head.  In order to make this assessment, it was ordered that a general survey of all the sheep in the realm chargeable to the tax should be made on the Tuesday after 24 June each year.After this assessment had been made, however, further calculation was necessary.  A sheep-owner only became liable to pay the relief of sheep if the amount he was assessed to pay exceeded the amount he had paid earlier in the year in respect of the subsidy on all his goods.  If this were the case, he paid the difference between the two.  This calculation was to be undertaken at an assembly of the commissioners within one month of the survey, and the extant records show the stages worked through to obtain each final assessment.Letters appointing the commissioners for this tax, who were to be as far as possible the same as those who had assessed the earlier tax on goods, were to be issued by 1 May each year, the estreats of assessment being due at the Exchequer by 10 October.  The money due from this tax had to be collected at the place where each sheep-owner lived.  Therefore, the estreats had to contain not only a record of the assessment already described, but also details of those persons who kept sheep in the area in question, but did not live there.  Payment of the tax was to be made at the Exchequer by 1 November.Assessment and collection of this tax was made amidst rising agrarian discontent.  Resistance to the tax explains to some extent why few related records survive, and was a contributory factor in the eruption of a major rebellion in the summer of 1549. The relief of sheep was abolished by an act passed in the next parliament, which repealed the tax from 4 November 1549 (see |Stat. Realm|, IV, pp 122-4, for the session 3-4 Edward VI, 1549-50).(|Stat.

641,1549 March 12 ,relief of cloth ,Edward VI ,"Parliament opened on 4 November 1548.  On 12 March 1549 the commons granted a \'relief\'.  This tax was composed of three elements: a subsidy on moveable goods, a purchase tax on cloth, and a poll tax on sheep.The relief of cloth was a tax of 8d. in the pound upon the value of every kind of woollen cloth made for sale after 24 June 1549, and it was to be levied and gathered yearly for the three years following that date.As also occurred in the levy of the relief of sheep, further calculation was necessary after the basic assessment.  If the amount the clothier was assessed to pay upon his cloth exceeded the amount he had paid earlier in the year in respect of the subsidy on all his goods, he was to pay on his cloth only.  (If such was the case, the subsidy he had already paid for that year would count as part of the payment for his cloth, and he would pay only the difference.)  Although it is not stated explicitly, the implication of the act seems to have been that, if the reverse were true, the clothier paid nothing towards the cloth tax.In order to assess this tax, the commissioners were to appoint sworn appraisers within their limits.  The appraisers (at least two of them at a time) were to estimate the true sale value of the cloths and record the details, after which the cloths would be sealed with a seal kept in the custody of the aulnager or his deputy.  The record of the cloths was to be entered in two books, and comprised the colour, kind, and value of the cloths, together with the name of the owner.  One of these books would be kept by the clothier and the other by the aulnager or his deputy, and at the end of the year, both were to be submitted to the commissioners.The assessments for the subsidy and the relief of cloth would then be compared and the commissioners would compile estreats of the sums to be collected by the high collectors.  The counterparts of these estreats were to be returned to the Exchequer by 10 October each year, together with the aulnager\'s book, the names of the appraisers, and details of any other proceedings taken.The relief of cloth was abolished along with the relief of sheep by an act passed in the next parliament, which repealed the tax from 4 November 1549 (see |Stat. Realm|, IV, pp 122-4, for the session 3-4 Edward VI, 1549-50). The preamble of this act notes that the relief of cloth \'appeareth now so comberouse to all cloth-makers, and also so tedious to the same for makinge of their bookes and the accounts thereof, by reason of the lacke of the Alnagers not always present when time requireth ... that in manner they are discouraged to make any cloth or to set any men on work about the same\'.No records have been discovered which relate to this tax, though Beresford notes that \'there is the chance that some of the commissioners preserved their copies of the assessments among their family papers\'.(|Stat.

902,1549 March 14 or earlier ,clerical subsidy ,Edward VI ,"The burden of taxation on the clergy had become very heavy, especially in the latter part of the reign of Henry VIII, and arrears in the clerical taxes granted to him were growing ever larger.  Accordingly, the first clerical subsidy granted by convocation to Edward VI, for the expenses of the \'great and long warres\' fought by his father, and confirmed in the second session of parliament that began on 24 November 1548 and sat until 14 March 1549, was to be levied at a reduced rate.  The subsidy was the familiar 6s. in the pound, but it was to be collected over three years, at the rate of 2s. in the pound each year.Its provisions were much the same as those of the subsidies granted in the previous reign, but with some modifications.  The tax of 2s. in the pound per annum was on income from all manner of benefices and clerical offices, and was to be paid by every archbishop, bishop, dean, archdeacon, prebendary, provost, master of college, master of hospital, parson, vicar and all other members of the clergy enjoying any spiritual promotion or other temporal possessions annexed to the same spiritual promotions.  A new feature of this subsidy grant, however, was that parsons and vicars whose benefices were valued at £6 13s. 4d. per annum or less were to pay only 6s.8d. per annum, the same rate as paid by stipendiary priests.The subsidy was to be levied according to the valuation made for first fruits and tenths, that is, the |Valor Ecclesiasticus| made in 1535, with deduction made for payment of the tenth part of their income, under the act of first fruits and tenths.  They were to be taxed for the subsidy, therefore, on nine-tenths of their income, and newly-created bishoprics and deaneries were to pay the subsidy according to the valuations made in 1543.  Allowable deductions from the taxable value of these new bishoprics, deaneries etc. were whatever portions of their revenue had been given for the maintenance of \'poore men, gramarions, queresters, students and other officers and ministers not to be charged with any part of this subsidie\'.As before, anyone subject to first fruits, that is, who was or will have been promoted to a benefice or office between 1 October 1548 and 1 October 1551, was wholly exempt from payment of this subsidy during the first year of his promotion.  Also exempt from payment of the subsidy were any benefices belonging to any college within the universities of Oxford or Cambridge, or to Eton College or Winchester College, or any benefices liable to pay fifteenths or other lay subsidies.Any clergy in receipt of a pension of more than 40s. per annum as a result of the dissolution of the monasteries, hospitals, colleges, chantries, fraternities or guilds was, however, liable to pay the subsidy on the income of his/her pension, and this tax was to be deducted from the payment of these pensions by the Court of Augmentations.  The chancellor of the Court of Augmentations was to retain this tax money on 29 September each year, notifying the Exchequer of the names and amounts of the pensions by 1 December of each year, and then pay it over to the Exchequer.  Anyone else liable to pay the subsidy who was also charged with paying pensions to the ex-religious were similarly to be allowed to retain the 2s. in the pound in each of the three years, and were likewise to certify the Exchequer of the names and amounts by 1 December each year, and then pay it over to the bishop or collector of the subsidy in their diocese.  Lay farmers or other lessees of forms of spiritual income were likewise liable to pay the subsidy on behalf of their landlords, unless they could produce any writings, covenants or bonds that showed otherwise.  Spiritual possessions were not subject to payment of fifteenths or other taxes granted by the laity, however.  No cathedrals, churches or other ecclesiastical places which had previously been charged with maintaining anniversaries, obits, lights, lamps etc. in chantries, which were now in the king\'s hands, were to pay any tax on any part or portion of income from such chantries to which the king was now entitled or possessed of, but were to have deduction and allowance made to them in their assessment for the subsidy accordingly. Unbeneficed clergy in receipt of an annual stipend were to pay a flat rate of 6s.8d. per annum in each of the two years.  The bishop or archbishop of each diocese was to certify the Exchequer of the names and the value of the stipends paid to these stipendiary priests by 1 January, or within 24 days thereafter, in each of the two years.  Any person or persons who paid a stipend or wage to any such priest within the term of this grant was to be charged with the payment of the 6s. 8d. on 1 October each \'for the insufficyencye or defaulte of everye of the same preist or preists being in service with him\'.The subsidy was to be collected by the bishops and their appointees in every diocese, or by the dean and chapter in the case of a vacant see, in the same way and with the same powers as episcopal collectors had under the act of first fruits and tenths.  The subsidy was to be paid in one annual payment on 1 October each year.  Any defaulting taxpayers would be deprived of their benefices or offices by their bishop after 40 days.  If collectors certified to the Exchequer, however, by 1 January, or within 24 days thereafter, that they were unable to collect the tax, then they would be discharged from responsibility for its collection, and the defaulter would be subject to Exchequer process against him to recover the outstanding amount.  Collectors were to account at the Exchequer, and were to be allowed 6d. of every pound for the charges of \'collection, portage, saufe conveying and paying\' of the subsidy, and were to receive an acquittance when accounting, for which acquittance the accountant would be charged the sum of 2d. per acquittance.Like the tenths collected under the act of first fruits and tenths, the receipts of the subsidy were handled by the treasurer of the Court of First Fruits and Tenths.  The individual collector prepared his account in draft (often much later) and it was then presented to the auditor and engrossed.  A number of these draft accounts for several dioceses have survived and, together with the accounts rendered by the treasurer, are listed in P.

257,1559 Feb 20 ,subsidy ,Elizabeth I ,"Parliament opened on 25 January 1559, and on 20 February the commons granted a subsidy to be levied over two years.For the first time, payment of the subsidy was to be made in two unequal payments, the greater amount to be paid first, an arrangement which was to become a recurrent feature throughout the reign of both Elizabeth I and James I.  Individuals with moveable goods worth  £5 or more, paid 20d. per pound in the first year, and 12d. per pound in the second.  Aliens were to pay the double rate of 3s.4d. per pound in the first year and 2s. per pound in the second.  On land, the minimum threshold of liability was 20s. per annum.  Native-born persons paid 2s.8d. per pound in the first year, and 16d. per pound in the second, while aliens paid the double rate of 5s.4d. and 2s.8d., respectively.  Aliens not liable in either category were subject to a poll tax of 4d. in each year.The statute set out that the first payment was to be assessed by 30 April 1559, certified at the Exchequer by 31 May 1559 and paid by 24 June 1559, although Herefordshire  documents give a payment date of 1 September 1559, which might suggest an altered date of payment in some cases.  The second was to be assessed by 20 January 1560, certified by 20 February 1560, and paid by 1 March 1560.Separate arrangements for payment in Wales (excluding Monmouthshire) and Cheshire were made, where payments towards the mise were in progress.  Payments towards the subsidy were to be delayed until the last payment of the mise had been made, and also, until after the last payment of the subsidies granted in the previous reign.  The date of payment for the first collection in those places was to be before 1 March following the last payment of the mise and subsidies, and for the second collection, by 1 March in the subsequent year.  Once again, the date of the final instalment of the mise was to be certified in the Exchequer by Pentecost next, that is, 14 May 1559.  Some Welsh documents, such as E 179/219/52 for Brecknockshire, dated 1569, reflect the delay.(|Stat. Realm|, IV, pp 349, 385-396; Cobbett, |Hist.

259,1563 Feb 23 ,subsidy ,Elizabeth I ,"Parliament opened on 12 January 1563, and on 23 February the commons granted a subsidy payable over two years. This subsidy is notable as being the one in which the minimum threshold of liability on moveable goods was lowered to £3, where it was to remain thereafter.  The rates were otherwise the same as those levied in 1559 and 1560, and the tax was again to be paid in two unequal payments.  On moveable goods, taxpayers were charged 20d. per pound in the first year and 12d. per pound in the second.  On lands, the universal threshold was 20s., on which a rate of 2s.8d. per pound was payable in the first year and 16d. per pound in the second.  Aliens paid double these rates, and those not chargeable in either category were subject to a charge of 4d. per head each year.A list of the commissioners appointed in each county, compiled in April 1563, survives in BL, Lansdowne MS 8, fos 77-81v.  Copies of letters to delinquent collectors of both the first and second payments, dated 8 March 1564, are in BL, Lansdowne MS 7, fos 112-115. The first payment was to be assessed by 20 April 1563, certified at the Exchequer by 20 May 1563 and paid by 1 June 1563.  The second was to be assessed by 10 December 1563, certified by 24 January 1564 and paid by 20 February 1564.Dates of payment in Wales (excluding Monmouthshire) and Cheshire, where the mise was being paid, were as follows:  the first collection was to be paid by 1 June following the date of the final instalment of the mise and also, of the two subsidies from the previous reign, and of the first subsidy of the reign of Elizabeth.  The second collection was to be paid by the subsequent 20 February.  The date of the last instalment of the mise was to be certified in the Exchequer by 30 May 1563.  Evidence for the delay  in collection is provided by some surviving Welsh documents, such as E 179/221/261 for Glamorgan, dated 1574.An assessment of individuals for the second collection of this subsidy for Builth hundred, Brecknockshire, is in the National Library of Wales in the Penpont Supplementary collection, 14.A roll containing a form of writ and lists of commissioners to collect the first payment of this tax for Wales (excluding Monmouthshire) is at TNA: PRO C 212/22/2 and for the second payment, for both England and Wales, is at TNA: PRO C 212/22/6.  In the second of these, Monmouthshire is listed with the English counties.It appears that Exchequer enquiries relating to the administration of this tax in parts of Wales arose, as depositions dating from 1580 made during investigations into the collection of the first payment in Denbighshire survive in The National Archives (E 134/22&amp;23Eliz/Mich8).  The assessment of first collection in Glamorgan was also investigated in 1586 (E 134/28Eliz/East15).(|Stat. Realm|, IV, pp 401, 464-478; Cobbett, |Hist.

261,1566 Dec 18 ,subsidy ,Elizabeth I ,"Parliament opened on 30 September 1566, and on 18 December the commons granted a subsidy leviable over two years.Individual taxpayers, as well as guilds and corporations, were taxed on moveable goods worth £3 or more at 12d. per pound for the first payment, and 10d. per pound for the second payment.  Aliens had to pay double these rates - 2s. per pound for the first payment and 20d. per pound for the second - and were taxable on all moveable property.  Native-born persons enjoying an income from land of 20s. per annum or more, were taxed at 16d. per pound for both payments, and aliens were to pay 2s.8d. for each payment on lands worth 20s. or more.  All aliens who had no taxable property in either category were subject to a poll tax of 4d. for the first payment and 2d. for the second.The first payment was to be assessed by 10 February 1567, certified at the Exchequer by 10 March 1567 and paid by 1 April 1567.  The second was to be assessed by 10 February 1568, certified by 10 March 1568 and paid by 1 April 1568.  A book giving details of the commissioners and collectors of this subsidy, and another listing the collectors and the dates on which they gave bonds to guarantee their collection, are at E 179/282/4-5.Separate instructions were given for collections in Wales (excluding Monmouthshire), where collections towards subsidies from the previous reign and from previous grants in Elizabeth\'s reign, were still being made.  These, in turn, had been delayed until after the date of payment of the final instalment of the mise or customary levy made by royal tenants and others at the start of each reign.  The first collection of the present subsidy was to be made by 1 June next after the final instalment of the earlier subsidies, and the second collection, by the subsequent 20 February.  Evidence for the delay in collection can be seen in such documents as E 179/219/54 for Brecknockshire and E 179/222/375 for Montgomeryshire, both dated in 1571, although the discrepancy between the original collection date and these documents is not so pronounced as that for earlier subsidies.(|Stat.

The minimum threshold of liability for income from land was 20s., above which native-born individuals were assessed to pay 2s.8d. per pound for the first payment and 16d. per pound for the second.  Aliens paid double these rates, and if they were not liable in either category, they were forced to pay a poll tax of 4d. per head per payment.The first payment was to be assessed by 20 September 1571, certified at the Exchequer by 20 October 1571 and paid by 20 November 1571; the second was to be assessed by 20 September 1572, certified by 20 October 1572 and paid by 20 November 1572.  A book of interim accounts of the collectors of the second payment of this subsidy is in E 179/282.In those counties of Wales (excluding Monmouthshire) where payments were still being made towards previous subsidies (delayed by earlier payments towards the mise), alternative collection dates were specified.  The first collection was to be paid by 1 November next after the date of the final instalment of the previous subsidy and the second collection, by the subsequent 1 June.  This delay is still evident in surviving Welsh documents such as E 179/220/113 for Carmarthenshire, dated 1574 and the account for the second collection for Radnorshire, at E 179/224/570, thought to date from early 1576 or later.A roll containing a form of writ and lists of commissioners for Wales (excluding Monmouthshire) to collect the first collection of this subsidy is at TNA: PRO C 212/22/4 and to collect the second collection, at TNA: PRO C 212/22/7.

The minimum threshold of liability of income from land was 20s., on which native-born persons paid, again in two inequal sums, 2s.8d. per pound for the first payment and 16d. per pound for the second.  Aliens paid double these rates, and those who were liable in either category had to pay a poll tax of 4d. per head per payment.A file of letters and memoranda relating to the appointment of commissioners to levy this subsidy in various counties survives in E 179/266/1.The first payment was to be assessed by 12 June 1576, certified at the Exchequer by 12 July 1576 and paid by 12 October 1576; the second was to be assessed by 20 September 1577, certified by 20 October 1577 and paid by 20 November 1577.  In contrast with previous grants of subsidies, no special instructions relating to collection in Wales (excluding Monmouthshire) were made; presumably payments towards earlier subsidies initially delayed by the collection of the mise, were all supposed to have been made by the time of the present grant.A typescript transcription of a document in private hands relating to the second collection of this subsidy is available in the Map Room.  This was presented by Mr Granville Proby of Elton Hall on 12 June 1945 (D MSS No. 114).A quietus to Sir Edward Carne for subsidy dues, relating to Glamorgan, dated Hilary term, 1577, probably relating to this subsidy, is in the National Library of Wales, ref.

The minimum threshold of liability for income from land was 20s., above which individuals paid 2s.8d. per pound for the first and third payments, and 16d. per pound for the second and fourth payments.  Aliens paid double the rates, and if they had no taxable property in either category, were forced to pay a poll tax of 4d. per head per payment.  The subsidy act contained a new provision that any children of aliens found to be holding property to the use of their parents, in order to enable those parents to escape payment, would be required to pay double subsidies.  Such provision suggests that this form of evasion had become common.Assessments were to be made by 1 October annually (1589-1592), and certified at the Exchequer by 1 November (1589-1592).

On the same day eight fifteenths and tenths were voted.  Parliament made it clear that the granting of such sums was not to be viewed as a precedent.The rates charged were the same as those levied by the subsidy of 1597, but the first subsidy was to be paid in one sum, and the other three were split into the two unequal payments of earlier subsidies.  For the first subsidy, to be levied in a single instalment, individuals (and corporations) paid 2s.8d. per pound for moveable goods worth £3 or more, and 4s. per pound for land worth 20s. or more per annum.  Aliens paid double these rates (5s.4d. per pound on moveable goods, and 8s. per pound for land).  Those aliens without taxable assets had to pay an 8d. per head poll tax for the first subsidy.For the other three subsidies, individuals were to pay 1s.8d. per pound for moveable goods for each of the first payments (that is, the second, fourth and sixth instalments), and 1s. per pound for each of the second payments (or the third, fifth and seventh instalments).  On lands, they were to pay 2s.8d. for the first payments, and 1s.4d. for the second payments.  On moveable goods, aliens had to pay a double rate of 3s.4d. for the first payments, and 2s. for the second payments, and on lands they were to pay 5s.4d. for the first payments, and 2s.8d. for the second payments.  Those aliens without taxable assets paid a poll tax of 4d. per head for both payments of the second, third and fourth subsidies.Payment was to be in February and June annually in 1602, 1603 and 1604 and in February 1605.In addition to those assessments for these subsidies among the E 179 records, the assessment rolls for half the county of Derbyshire (the hundreds of Appletree, Morleyston and Litchurch, and Repton and Gresley) for the first payment of the third subsidy (or fourth instalment) were never returned to the Exchequer, and are among the Coke-Steel MSS at Trusley Hall, Derbyshire (refs: SR/1, SR/2 and SR/3).

553,1593 April 9 ,weekly assessment for the relief of maimed soldiers ,Elizabeth I ,"Parliament opened on 19 February 1593 and on 9 April, three days before its adjournment, passed an act entitled \'an acte for relief of souldiours\'.  According to the |House of Lords Journal|, the genesis of the act lay in a motion proposed by the bishop of Worcester on 13 March, in which he asked the lords for a contribution for the relief of the poor soldiers seen begging in the streets of London.  Every archbishop, marquis, earl and viscount was to give 40s., every bishop 30s. and every baron 20s.  Collectors and distributors of the aid were appointed, and those lords who had been absent from all the sessions of that parliament were to be asked to contribute double the rates imposed on those who had attended.  Lords attending some sessions would be required to pay a third more than those regularly present.  In view of the fact that there were so many impoverished soldiers, only those maimed in the continental wars were eligible to receive the relief.The act promulgated on 9 April sought to standardise and extend this provision of charity to every parish.  Every soldier or mariner who had lost limb(s) or otherwise disabled his body in the defence and service of the queen and \'the State\', was to be given a quarterly pension upon production of a certificate attesting to his service.  Those who had served as lieutenants were to receive a maximum of £20 per annum, while officers of lower rank could be given £15, and common soldiers and mariners holding no office would be provided with no more than an annual pension of £10.To pay for these pensions, a weekly charge was to be made in every parish in England and Wales, payable at the general quarter sessions held in each county, to begin two months after the last day of the present session of parliament.  No parish was to be assessed at more than 6d., nor under 1d., weekly.  Any county which contained more than 50 parishes would not be rated at more than 2d. per week.  The county justices of the peace were given the authority to assign the sum chargeable upon each parish, and once these had been decided, the assessment within the parish was to be made annually \'by the agreament of the parisshioners within themselves\', or if such agreement could not be reached, by the churchwardens and constables of the parish, or a majority of them.  If the consensus of this body could not be had, then justices of the peace living in the parish, or in an adjoining parish, would be empowered to assess the parishioners.The charge was to be collected by the churchwardens of each parish, who were to pay it over to the high constable of their division of the county within the ten days preceding the quarter sessions.  Justices of the peace were to appoint treasurers from amongst themselves to receive the money from the latter.  Distraint, followed by sale of their goods and chattels was authorised against all those refusing or neglecting to pay.  Churchwardens and high constables negligent in their duty would be fined 10s., and treasurers doing the same were liable to pay a fine of 40s., to be levied by distress and sale of goods.The relief collected was to be disbursed at the county level by the treasurers appointed by the justices of the peace, and was to be paid to the soldiers and sailors in the counties in which they were resident, or in which they had been pressed into service.  Soldiers or mariners found begging would forfeit the pension.The act was to be in force only until \'thend of the next session of parliament\'.The tax was continued until the end of the following parliament by a statute which was passed in the parliament which opened on 24 October 1597 and adjourned on 9 February 1598.  Several amendments were made to the act of 1593.  It was recognised that the pensions provided to some soldiers (some as low as £5) had been inadequate, and the allowable rates of assessment were raised accordingly.  No parish could be rated at more than 8d. per week and none lower than 2d.  In counties of more than 50 parishes, no parish was to pay more than 4d.  In London, where the previous provisions were probably thought inappropriate, the mayor, recorder and aldermen were given discretionary powers to raise between 2d-8d. weekly in each parish.  Treasurers elected by the justices of the peace had to be worth £10 per annum in lands or £20 in goods \'in the subsidye booke\'.  Justices of the peace were given the power to revoke or alter the amount of relief provided to the soldiers, at their discretion.  The penalty fine on negligent churchwardens and constables was raised to 20s.At the following parliament, which opened on 27 October 1601 and was adjourned on 19 December 1601, the relief was again extended to the end of the next parliament.  The leviable rates per parish were narrowed to between 2d. and 6d., and the penalty upon negligent treasurers was raised to £5.  Treasurers were required to keep a \'true booke of computacion of all such summes as they levie\', as well as a register of names of those to whom they distributed relief.  The act also provided for the payment of arrears of pensions authorised under the previous acts, and increased the amount leviable each week in London to between 12d. and 3s. per parish.(|Stat.

613,1562 Dec 27 or earlier ,privy seal loan ,Elizabeth I ,"This loan was the first of several forced loans imposed by Elizabeth I, and seems to have been demanded only of her wealthier subjects.  In Devon, for example, £1,333 6s.8d. was lent by only fifteen persons, and in Hertfordshire loans of £100 each were paid by two people.  Use was made of a book containing the names of persons who had lent money to Queen Mary in 1556 to locate potential lenders (E 34/4).The names of all lenders are listed in the accounts of Sir Edward Rogers, receiver-general of the loan.  The levy of the loan lasted for over a year, as his accounts are for the period 27 December 1562 to 25 March 1564.  Original privy seal letters issued to lenders are in E 34/15 and E 34/42.  Total receipts of the loan were £43,886 13s.4d., the bulk of which was repaid in 1564.(Hoyle, |Tudor Taxation Records|, pp 42, 48; F.C.

614,1569 March ,privy seal loan ,Elizabeth I ,"The financing of military operations against the Spanish in 1570 necessitated the levying of a forced loan, and in March and April 1569 letters were sent by the queen\'s council appointing collectors of a loan to be levied by privy seal letters.  Lenders were to be promised repayment in November 1571.There was a good deal of opposition to the loan, and commissioners were told to make fresh investigations and send the names of \'able men\' to the council who had not been previously asked for a loan.  The names of persons able to lend £20 or more were returned to the council by some commissioners, but the latter were subsequently instructed to ask only those who could afford £50.The account of Thomas Heneage, receiver-general of the loan, gives not only the totals received, but also the names of the individuals who lent money, organised by county.  His total receipts for the period 21 April 1570-25 May 1572 were £52,588 6s.8d.  Correspondence about the levying of the loan and lists of person able to contribute can be found among the State Papers, especially SP12/67, while correspondence regarding receipts and balances are in SP12/73, nos. 54, 57 and SP12/83, no. 14.  Other references to the loan are in BL, Cotton MS Faustina C.II, fos. 143, 146.

615,c. 1588 Nov ,privy seal loan ,Elizabeth I ,"Following the English victory over the Spanish Armada, it was determined that a supply of ready cash was needed for future emergencies in the war with Spain.  In the late summer of 1588, a loan of almost £50,000 was negotiated with the livery companies of London, and in early December the lords lieutenant of the shires were charged with levying a general loan by privy seal.  Each one was given a fixed sum to be levied in his respective county, to be apportioned at his discretion among those most able to lend, in amounts of £25 to £100.The lord lieutenant of Northamptonshire, for example, was sent his commission on 14 December, which instructed him to raise a total of £4,000 \'or rather more\'.  He was to take special note of any officials of the queen\'s courts of record or revenue residing in the county, and to return in writing the names and places of residence of all likely contributors.  On 16 January 1589, the queen\'s formal authority to seek loans was given, and on 21 January the privy council wrote again to the lord lieutenant of Northants., directing him to send out the letters of privy seal.  The county justices of the peace were to divide themselves and meet with those in their area to whom the privy seals were addressed.  Persuasion and \'friendly admonition\' were to be employed to convince reluctant lenders.  Anyone sent a privy seal who resisted was to be forced to give bonds to the JPs for their appearance before the deputy lieutenants.  At the latter interviews, persuasion was also to be used in the first instance, but further recalcitrance was to be met by the threat of enquiry into the true value of the reluctant lender\'s estate and a resulting less favourable rate of assessment in the levy of the next subsidy.  The lord lieutenant was also informed of whom the privy council wished to be appointed collector (BL, Cotton MS Titus B.V, fos 163-164, 167).  Upon receipt of a certificate from the lord lieutenant, the collector was to collect the money and deliver it to the receiver of the loan.  The certificate sent to the Bedfordshire collector, John Thomson, was dated 13 March 1589 (BL, Cotton MS Titus B.IV, fo 177v).  A list of collectors appointed by the privy council in every shire, with the annotations of lord Burghley, is at BL, Harl MS 366, fo 170.Several thousand cancelled privy seal letters survive in E 34/16-40.  The text of the |pro forma| letter was strongly worded, stressing the unprecedented danger in which the kingdom stood as a result of the \'great preparations\' made by the king of Spain in the previous year, which \'tended directly to the conquest of this realme\'.  Forty-five such letters in E 34/41, all dated in November and December 1588, record loans from Londoners.  Lenders were to be repaid within a year.  A register of lenders of the loan, arranged by county, and listing the names and dates of payment, is now BL, Stowe MS 165.  A printed edition of the names of the lenders, probably compiled from this manuscript, was published as F.C. Noble, |The names of those persons who subscribed towards the defence of the county at the time of the Spanish Armada, 1588\' (1886), although London, the far northern and the Welsh counties have been excluded from both this edition and Stowe MS 165.  A list of contributors to a loan of £15,000 by London, dated 6 November 1589, to be repaid a year later, is in BL, Lansdowne MS 60, fos 46-47v.  Other individual county lists of contributors also exist for Bedfordshire (BL, Cotton MS Titus B.IV, fos 176v-177) Hertfordshire, (BL, Lansdowne MS 83, fo 43) and Lincolnshire (BL, Lansdowne MS 81, fos 137-142).  The lists for the latter two counties indicate that loans of £20 were accepted there.(Dietz, |English Public Finance 1558-1641|, pp 62-63; Hoyle, |Tudor Taxation Records|, p 49) ",Origin  Imposed,1st: 1589 Jan - March
616,1590 Nov ,privy seal loan ,Elizabeth I ,"In November 1590, another general loan \'for the defence of the realm\' began to be levied by privy seal letter in much the same way as in 1588-89.  Individual contributions again ranged from £20-100.A file of cancelled privy seal letters, all dated in November and December 1590 is in E 34/41.  All promise repayment \'at the end of one year\' and record that the lender was repaid in 1592.  The actual collection probably began in February 1591; an extant letter of appointment of the Bedfordshire collector was dated 20 January (BL, Cotton MS Titus B.V, fo 169).  One privy seal letter, dated 13 September 1591, is printed in |Tudor Constitution|, p 58.  The recipient of that letter paid his loan on 15 November 1591, but did not secure repayment until 6 November 1594.A volume among the State Papers contains a list of the collectors appointed by the privy council as well as a register of lenders, organised into three sections.  One section lists contributors in London arranged by size of loan, another gives details of the contributions made by the clergy, organised by diocese (including Wales), and a third section lists contributors to the loan by county, ending with York.  Cheshire, Lancashire, Yorkshire and the other northern counties are excluded from the book, however, as is Wales (SP 12/236).  Individual county lists of contributors also exist in BL, Lansdowne MS 83, fo 43 (Hertfordshire) and Lansdowne MS 63, fos 46-47v (Cambridgeshire and the Isle of Ely).(Hoyle, |Tudor Taxation Records|, p 49) ",Origin  Imposed,1st: 1591 Jan - Nov
617,1597 Feb 2 ,forced loan ,Elizabeth I ,"On 2 February 1597, the privy council appointed collectors in all the counties to levy a forced loan.  The same collectors as had been charged with gathering the previous loan (in 1590-91) were again appointed, since they knew who all the persons were who had lent money on that occasion.  They were instructed to make enquiries as to whether these persons were still alive and living in the county, and if not, who now occupied their estates, and to certify the results to the council as quickly as they could.  They were also to seek out others now living in the county who had not contributed to the last loan, and who would be able to lend, and return a certificate of their details to the council.  The county sheriff, justices of the peace and keeper of the rolls were to be consulted \'for better knowledge\' of these potential lenders.  An annotated list of lenders of the loans of 1588-89 and 1590-91 in Hertfordshire also makes clear that these lists were employed to identify likely contributors to the 1597 loan (BL, Lansdowne MS 83, fo 143).Later correspondence indicates that collection of the loan began in June and was to continue to November, but in August the collectors were notified by the privy council that the levy of the loan was to be delayed until further notice.  Lists of the collectors appointed in several counties, together with these instructions, were copied into the register of proceedings of the privy council. Whatever the cause for the delay in levying the loan, it was not to last for very long, for receipts are recorded in a teller\'s receipt book of payments of the loan in Michaelmas term 1597.  In this book, names of the lenders are arranged by county, and the entries reveal also the amounts lent and the dates on which payment was made.  Most contributors paid £20 (E 401/2583).  Individual county returns for Devon, Hertfordshire and London are in E 401/2585)  Both clergy and laymen contributed to this loan.(Hoyle, |Tudor Taxation Records|, pp 42, 49; |Acts of the Privy Council|, XXVI, 1596-7, pp 459-460; XXVII, 1597, pp 346-348; P.

905,1563 April 10 or earlier ,clerical subsidy ,Elizabeth I ,"The grant of a subsidy by convocations of the clergy of both provinces was confirmed in the first session of the parliament which began on 12 January and ended on 10 April 1563.  The subsidy granted was 6s. in the pound, payable over three years, and it was granted for the repairing and furnishing of the queen\'s navy and the provision of armour and munitions necessary for the defence and safeguarding of the realm, which at the beginning of her reign was \'voyde and destitute\'.As in previous subsidies, the tax of 2s. in the pound per annum was on income from all manner of benefices and clerical offices, and was to be paid by every archbishop, bishop, dean, archdeacon, prebendary, provost, master of college, master of hospital, parson, vicar and all other members of the clergy enjoying any spiritual promotion or other temporal possessions annexed to the same spiritual promotions.  Parsons and vicars whose benefices were valued at £5 per annum or less were wholly exempt.The subsidy was to be levied according to the valuation made for first fruits and tenths, with deduction made for payment of the tenth part of their income, under the act of first fruits and tenths.  The clergy were to be taxed for the subsidy, therefore, on nine-tenths of their income.  No one promoted to a benefice or office between 30 September 1562 and 30 September 1565, and liable to pay first fruits, was to pay the subsidy.  Allowable deductions from the taxable value of new bishoprics, deaneries etc. were whatever portions of their revenue had been given for the maintenance of poor men, school masters, ushers, grammarians, choristers, petty canons, vicars choral, readers of divinity and other officers and ministers.Exempt from payment of the subsidy were any benefices, almshouses, hospitals or grammar schools belonging to any college within the universities of Oxford or Cambridge, or to Eton College or Winchester College, any poor men, women or children living on alms in any hospitals, almshouses or alms halls, or any benefices liable to pay fifteenths or other lay subsidies.  No cathedrals, churches or other ecclesiastical places which had previously been charged with maintaining anniversaries, obits, lights, lamps etc. in chantries, which were now in the queen\'s hands, were to pay any tax on any part or portion of income from such chantries to which the queen was now entitled or possessed of, but were to have deduction and allowance made to them in their assessment for the subsidy accordingly. Any clergy in receipt of a pension of 40s. per annum or less as a result of the dissolution of the monasteries, hospitals, colleges, chantries, fraternities, guilds or other incorporations was, however, liable to pay the subsidy on the income of his/her pension.  Anyone else liable to pay the subsidy who was also charged with paying pensions to the ex-religious were to be allowed to retain the 2s. in the pound in each of the four years, to his own relief. Lay farmers or other lessees of forms of spiritual income were likewise liable to pay the subsidy on behalf of their landlords, unless they could produce any writings, covenants or bonds that showed otherwise. Spiritual possessions were not subject to payment of fifteenths or other taxes granted by the laity, however.  Graduated rates were to be paid by stipendiary clergy.  Unbeneficed clergy in receipt of an annual stipend of £8 or less were to pay a flat rate of 6s.8d. per annum in each of the three years, those receiving an annual stipend of more than £8 up to £10 were to pay 10s. each year, those receiving an annual stipend of more than £10 up to £13 6s. 8d. were to pay 13s. 4d. each year, and those receiving an annual stipend of more than £13 6s. 8d. were to pay 12d. in the pound each year, just as beneficed clergy.  The subsidy was to be collected by the bishops and their appointees in every diocese, or by the dean and chapter in the case of a vacant see.  Collectors were to certify to the Exchequer the names and surnames of all stipendiary priests chargeable to the subsidy by 24 January each year.  The subsidy was to be collected in one annual payment on 30 September each year, and paid into the Exchequer by the following 13 January.  Collectors were empowered to compel payment of the subsidy from any defaulters by sequestration of the fruits and profits of their benefices or offices, after lawful warning given to them, and to release them from any ecclesiastical censures under which they had been placed, once their payment had been received, and revoke all process made against them.  For the first time, collectors or bishops could sell goods distrained from defaulters, remitting the money receiving for them to the Exchequer.  After a first refusal to pay, the defaulter was liable for the collector\'s costs in coming, going and demanding the tax, and after a second refusal, he was bound to pay the fourth part of the subsidy in addition to the amount that he had been assessed to pay.

906,1566 Dec 7 or earlier ,clerical subsidy ,Elizabeth I ,"The grant of a subsidy by convocation of the clergy of both provinces was confirmed in the parliament which began on 30 September 1566 and was dissolved on 2 January 1567.  On 7 December 1566 a delegation of bishops delivered the grant of the Canterbury convocation to the queen, the final text of the bill having clearly been approved by that date.The subsidy granted was to be levied at a lower rate than recent subsidies, and there were a number of new provisions which tightened up the administration of the tax.  The tax of 4s. in the pound per annum, payable over three years at 1s. 4d. in the pound each year, was, as before, on income from all manner of benefices and clerical offices, and was to be paid by every archbishop, bishop, dean, archdeacon, prebendary, provost, master of college, master of hospital, parson, vicar and all other members of the clergy enjoying any spiritual promotion or other temporal possessions annexed to the same spiritual promotions.  The threshold of liability of holders of benefices was raised under the terms of this subsidy act.  Parsons, vicars and other clergy whose benefices were valued at £6 13s. 4d. per annum or less were wholly exempt, and vicars whose benefices were valued at more than £6 13s. 4d., up to £10, were to pay only 6s. 8d. in each year.  Only vicars whose benefices were worth more than £10 per annum, therefore, were to pay the rate of 1s. 4d. in the pound in each year.The subsidy was to be levied according to the valuation made for first fruits and tenths, with deduction made for payment of the tenth part of their income, under the act of first fruits and tenths.  The clergy were to be taxed for the subsidy, therefore, on nine-tenths of their income.  No one promoted to a benefice or office between 24 May 1566 and 24 May 1569, and liable to pay first fruits, was to pay the subsidy.  Allowable deductions from the taxable value of new bishoprics, deaneries, cathedral or collegiate churches, or colleges, etc. were whatever portions of their revenue had been given for the maintenance of poor men, school masters, ushers, grammarians, choristers, petty canons, vicars choral, readers of divinity, singing men, vergers and other necessary and daily officers or ministers, and the expenses of rebuilding or repairing of any cathedral or collegiate churches or colleges.  These deductions were to be certified to the Exchequer, upon due search and examination by the bishop or archbishop (or by the dean and chapter, in the event of a vacant see), by 31 October each year.Exempt from payment of the subsidy were any benefices, almshouses, hospitals or grammar schools belonging to any college within the universities of Oxford or Cambridge, or to Eton College or Winchester College, any poor men, women or children living on alms in any hospitals, almshouses or alms halls, or any benefices liable to pay fifteenths or other lay subsidies.  No cathedrals, churches or other ecclesiastical places which had previously been charged with maintaining anniversaries, obits, lights, lamps etc. in chantries, which were now in the queen\'s hands, were to pay any tax on any part or portion of income from such chantries to which the queen was now entitled or possessed of, but were to have deduction and allowance made to them in their assessment for the subsidy accordingly. Any member of the clergy in receipt of a pension of 40s. per annum or less as a result of the dissolution of the monasteries, hospitals, colleges, chantries, free chapels, fraternities, guilds or other incorporations was, however, liable to pay the subsidy on the income of his/her pension.  Anyone else liable to pay the subsidy who was also charged with paying pensions to the ex-religious were to be allowed to retain the 1s. 4d. in the pound in each of the three years, to his own relief.  Those pensioners paid their pensions at the Exchequer were to have the tax withheld at the Exchequer.  Lay farmers or other lessees of forms of spiritual income were likewise liable to pay the subsidy on behalf of their landlords, unless they could produce any writings, covenants or bonds that showed otherwise.  Spiritual possessions were not subject to payment of fifteenths or other taxes granted by the laity, however.  No longer were the stipendiary clergy to be taxed at graduated rates, and a lower threshold of liability was also instituted.  Unbeneficed clergy in receipt of an annual stipend of £6 13s. 4d. or more were to pay a flat rate of 6s.8d. per annum in each of the three years.  Should any such clergy default in payment of the tax, their employer, whether a parson, vicar or lay person, would be liable for the tax.The subsidy was to be collected by the bishops and their appointees in every diocese, or by the dean and chapter in the case of a vacant see.  Collectors were to certify to the Exchequer the names and surnames of all stipendiary priests chargeable to the subsidy by 31 October each year.  They were also to certify the names of all deputy collectors appointed.  The subsidy was to be collected in one annual payment on 24 May each year, and paid into the Exchequer by the following 31 October, receiving an acquittance upon payment of the tax money, for which the collector was to be charged only 4d.Collectors were empowered to compel payment of the subsidy from any defaulters by sequestration of the fruits and profits of their benefices or offices, after lawful warning given to them, and to release them from any ecclesiastical censures under which they had been placed, once their payment had been received, and revoke all process made against them.  Collectors or bishops could sell goods distrained from defaulters, remitting the money received for them to the Exchequer.  After a first refusal to pay, the defaulter was liable for the collector\'s costs in coming, going and demanding the tax, and after a second refusal, he was bound to pay the fourth part of the subsidy in addition to the amount that he had been assessed to pay.  In the event of obstinate and persistent refusal to pay, the defaulter would be deprived of his benefice or office after due warning. Collectors were to be discharged of any amounts that they certified to the Exchequer by 31 October each year that they were unable to collect from defaulters, and the form and exact wording of this certificate was specified in the subsidy act.New provisions attempted to streamline the accounting procedure at the Exchequer.  Within four days of the collector\'s arrival at the Exchequer with the tax money, the appointed receiver was to receive the money and deliver a receipt to the collector or his deputy for every payment made.  Auditors of collectors\' accounts were to hear and audit their accounts within six days after a request to account had been made, and were to give bonds to this effect.  For every default or delay in the accounting procedure, the auditor was to be fined £10, half of which was to be paid to the collector so inconvenienced and half to the crown, upon complaint made to the treasurer, under-treasurer or chief baron of the Exchequer.  The offending auditor was to be imprisoned until paying the forfeited sum.  Collectors were to be allowed 6d. of every pound for the charges of collection, carrying and paying in of the subsidy, and were to receive an acquittance at their final accounting each year, for which acquittance the accountant would be charged the sum of 3s.4d. to be paid to the clerk for writing it.(|Stat Realm|, IV, pp 500-505 (8 Elizabeth, c. 17); P.

907,1571 May 29 or earlier ,clerical subsidy ,Elizabeth I ,"The clergy of both provinces granted the queen a subsidy, the text of which was delivered to her by Matthew Parker, archbishop of Canterbury, as the subsidy act expressly states, and confirmed in the parliament which began on 2 April 1571 and ended on 29 May 1571.  The subsidy was granted for the expenses of abating all hostility and persecution within the realm of France, reducing the Scots to a unity and concord among themselves and defending and preserving the realm of England against all assaults of foreign enemies.The subsidy granted was a tax of 6s. in the pound per annum, payable over three years at 2s. in the pound each year - a return to the rate levied before 1566.  The tax was to be paid, as before, on income from all manner of benefices and clerical offices by every archbishop, bishop, dean, archdeacon, prebendary, provost, master of college, master of hospital, parson, vicar and all other members of the clergy enjoying any spiritual promotion or other temporal possessions annexed to the same spiritual promotions.

Unbeneficed clergy in receipt of an annual stipend of £6 13s. 4d. or more were to pay a flat rate of 6s.8d. per annum in each of the three years.

The clergy of York province made a like grant, and both grants were confirmed in the parliament that assembled on 4 February 1585 and sat until 29 March 1585.  The subsidy was again granted for the defence and preservation of the realm and the great charges with which the queen was, or was likely to be, burdened \'by reason of popishe mutynies and attempts to the overthrowe of trewe religion\' and the queen\'s estate.As before, the subsidy was to be levied on income from all manner of benefices and clerical offices, and paid by every archbishop, bishop, dean, archdeacon, prebendary, provost, master of college, master of hospital, parson, vicar and all other members of the clergy enjoying any spiritual promotion or other temporal possessions annexed to the same spiritual promotions. Parsons, vicars and other clergy whose benefices were valued at less than £6 13s. 4d. per annum were wholly exempt. Vicars whose benefices were valued at less than £8 per annum were also wholly exempt, and vicars whose benefices were valued at between £8 and £10 per annum were to pay only 6s. 8d. in each year.  Only benefices worth more than £10 per annum, therefore, were to pay the rate of 2s. in the pound in each year.The subsidy was to be levied according to the valuation made for first fruits and tenths, with deduction made for payment of the tenth part of their income, under the act of first fruits and tenths. The clergy were to be taxed for the subsidy, therefore, on nine-tenths of their income. No one promoted to a benefice or office between 2 October 1584 and 2 October 1587, and liable to pay first fruits, was to pay the subsidy. Allowable deductions from the taxable value of new bishoprics, deaneries, cathedral or collegiate churches, or colleges, etc. were whatever portions of their revenue had been given for the maintenance of poor men, school masters, ushers, grammarians, choristers, petty canons, vicars choral, readers of divinity, singing men, vergers and other necessary and daily officers or ministers, and the expenses of rebuilding or repairing of any cathedral or collegiate churches or colleges. These deductions were to be certified to the Exchequer, upon due search and examination by the bishop or archbishop (or by the dean and chapter, in the event of a vacant see), by 22 January each year.Exempt from payment of the subsidy were any benefices, almshouses, hospitals or grammar schools belonging to any college within the universities of Oxford or Cambridge, or to Eton College or Winchester College, any poor men, women or children living on alms in any hospitals, almshouses or alms halls, or any benefices liable to pay fifteenths or other lay subsidies. No cathedrals, churches or other ecclesiastical places which had previously been charged with maintaining anniversaries, obits, lights, lamps etc. in chantries, which were now in the queen\'s hands, were to pay any tax on any part or portion of income from such chantries to which the queen was now entitled or possessed of, but were to have deduction and allowance made to them in their assessment for the subsidy accordingly. The same was to be true of concealed lands, which had previously been in the hands of cathedrals or churches, but were no longer in their possession. The threshold of liability of pensioned, ex-monastic clergy was raised from the previous subsidy by this act. Any member of the clergy in receipt of a pension of £5 per annum or more as a result of the dissolution of the monasteries, hospitals, colleges, chantries, free chapels, fraternities, guilds or other incorporations was, however, liable to pay the subsidy on the income of his/her pension. Anyone else liable to pay the subsidy who was also charged with paying pensions to the ex-religious were to be allowed to retain the 2s. in the pound in each of the three years, to his own relief. Those pensioners paid their pensions at the Exchequer were to have the tax withheld at the Exchequer. Lay farmers or other lessees of forms of spiritual income were likewise liable to pay the subsidy on behalf of their landlords, unless they could produce any writings, covenants or bonds that showed otherwise. Spiritual possessions were not subject to payment of fifteenths or other taxes granted by the laity, however.  As before, unbeneficed clergy in receipt of an annual stipend of £8 or more were to pay a flat rate of 6s.8d. per annum in each of the three years. Should any such clergy default in payment of the tax, their employer, whether a parson, vicar or lay person, would be liable for the tax, and would be allowed to withhold the wages of the defaulter to recover the sum owed.The subsidy was to be collected by the bishops and their appointees in every diocese, or by the dean and chapter in the case of a vacant see. Collectors were to certify to the Exchequer the names and surnames of all stipendiary priests chargeable to the subsidy by 22 January each year. They were also to certify the names of all deputy collectors appointed. The subsidy was to be collected in one annual payment on 2 October each year, and paid into the Exchequer by the following 22 January, receiving an acquittance upon payment of the tax money, for which the collector was to be charged only 4d.Collectors were empowered to compel payment of the subsidy from any defaulters by sequestration of the fruits and profits of their benefices or offices, after lawful warning given to them, and to release them from any ecclesiastical censures under which they had been placed, once their payment had been received, and revoke all process made against them.  Collectors or bishops could sell goods distrained from defaulters, remitting the money received for them to the Exchequer.  After a first refusal to pay, the defaulter was liable for the collector\'s costs in coming, going and demanding the tax, and after a second refusal, he was bound to pay the fourth part of the subsidy in addition to the amount that he had been assessed to pay.  In the event of obstinate and persistent refusal to pay, the defaulter would be deprived of his benefice or office after due warning. Collectors were to be discharged of any amounts that they certified to the Exchequer by 22 January each year that they were unable to collect from defaulters, and the form and exact wording of this certificate was specified in the subsidy act.Within four days of the collector\'s arrival at the Exchequer with the tax money, the appointed receiver was to receive the money and deliver a receipt to the collector or his deputy for every payment made.  Auditors of collectors\' accounts were to hear and audit their accounts within six days after a request to account had been made, and were to give bonds to this effect.  For every default or delay in the accounting procedure, the auditor was to be fined £10, half of which was to be paid to the collector so inconvenienced and half to the crown, upon complaint made to the treasurer, under-treasurer or chief baron of the Exchequer.  The offending auditor was to be imprisoned until paying the forfeited sum.  All acquittances given by collectors to taxpayers were to be honoured at the Exchequer, and if they were not, then the offender was to be subject to the same penalties as above specified.  Collectors were to be allowed 6d. of every pound for the charges of collection, carrying and paying in of the subsidy, and were to receive an acquittance at their final accounting each year, for which acquittance the accountant would be charged the sum of 3s.4d. to be paid to the clerk for writing it.(|Stat Realm|, IV, pp 738-743 (27 Elizabeth, c. 28); P.

911,1587 March 3 - 9 ,clerical subsidy ,Elizabeth I ,"A convocation of the clergy of Canterbury province was summoned at St. Paul\'s, London, by royal writ, on 16 October 1586.  It was prorogued until 27 October 1586, two days before parliament was convened at Westminster.  On 3 March 1587 the southern clergy granted the queen a subsidy of 6s. in the pound, payable over three years, as well as a \'benevolence\'.  On 7 March 1587, the texts of both grants were received at York, where the clergy of the northern province had assembled, and two days later, they gave their assent to an identical grant.  The texts of both grants made by the York clergy were engrossed by the dean and chapter of York and returned to London for the seal of the archbishop of York.  The combined grants of both provinces were then presented to the queen.  The subsidy was granted because of \'greate and ymportable chardges\' that the queen had sustained in the necessary provision of all kinds of munitions for the fortification by both sea and land of her dominions and the withstanding of foreign invasion.  It was confirmed in the parliament that sat between 29 October 1586 and 23 March 1587. As before, the subsidy was to be levied on income from all manner of benefices and clerical offices, and paid by every archbishop, bishop, dean, archdeacon, prebendary, provost, master of college, master of hospital, parson, vicar and all other members of the clergy enjoying any spiritual promotion or other temporal possessions annexed to the same spiritual promotions.

912,1587 March 3 - 9 ,clerical benevolence ,Elizabeth I ,"A convocation of the clergy of Canterbury province was summoned at St. Paul\'s, London, by royal writ, on 16 October 1586.  It was prorogued until 27 October 1586, two days before parliament was convened at Westminster.  On 3 March 1587 the southern clergy granted the queen a subsidy, and a \'benevolence\'.  On 7 March 1587, the texts of both grants were received at York, where the clergy of the northern province had assembled, and two days later, they gave their assent to an identical grant.  The texts of both grants made by the York clergy were engrossed by the dean and chapter of York and returned to London for the seal of the archbishop of York; the original grant is now E 179/67/63, still with the archbishop\'s seal attached. The combined grants of both provinces were then presented to the queen.The benevolence had been granted in gratitude for \'the free exercise of [their] mynistery and function, the true preachinge of God, and the syncere admynistringe of His holly Sacraments (to us farre more deare than our lyves and lyvinges)\' (|Records of Northern Convocation|, p 263; E 179/67/63). This grant was not confirmed by parliament, but was sanctioned by royal licence made under letters patent, dated 10 and 14 March 1587, which authorised the clergy of each province to make decrees and ordinances in convocation ordering its collection. The benevolence was, in effect, merely half of the standard subsidy of 6s. in the pound under another name.  It was a tax of 3s. in the pound to be levied, as usual, on income from all manner of benefices and clerical offices, and paid by every archbishop, bishop, dean, archdeacon, prebendary, provost, master of college, master of hospital, parson, vicar and all other members of the clergy enjoying any spiritual promotion or other temporal possessions annexed to the same spiritual promotions.All vicars whose benefices were valued at less than £10 per annum were, however, wholly exempt from payment of the benevolence, as were all lands, revenues, possessions, benefices and appropriations belonging to the universities, halls, colleges or houses of students of Cambridge or Oxford, and the collegiate church of Westminster, the college of St. George, Windsor, Eton College, Winchester College, or to any almshouse, hospital or grammar school, or assigned, appointed or used to maintain any preacher, reader of divinity, poor man, school master, usher, grammarian, petty canon, conduct, vicar choral, singing man, chorister, verger or any other necessary inferior officer in any cathedral, collegiate church or college, or towards the re-building or repairing of any cathedral or collegiate church.  No mention was made in the text of the grant of ex-monastic clergy in receipt of pensions nor of stipendiary clergy, and it must be presumed that they were not liable for payment of the benevolence.The benevolence was to be levied according to the valuation made for first fruits and tenths, with deduction made for payment of the tenth part of their income, under the act of first fruits and tenths.  The benevolence was to be collected on 1 May each year.  It was to be paid to such person(s) as the queen appointed to receive it, in three yearly payments, of 1s. in the pound.  The names of the sub-collectors appointed by each bishop or dean and chapter were to be certified to the archbishop by 31 May each year.  The usual powers of compelling payment from defaulters were in effect, and their names were to be certified to the archbishop by 20 July each year in order for collectors to be discharged of responsibility for collecting the benevolence from them.  Collectors were to receive 4d. in the pound of every pound collected for the expenses of collection and portage, who were to be able to account for their receipts free of charge, except for a charge of 3s.4d. to be paid for a general acquittance in each of the three years.The declared account of the bishops of the province of Canterbury for the first payment is now Lambeth Palace Library, CM I/81. See also E 336/21. A certificate sent to the Exchequer by the archbishop of York, confirming that the total sum of £380 16s. had been collected in his diocese for the first payment, dated 6 October 1587, is now E 179/65/366. The benevolence yielded in total almost £15,000.(Wilkins, |Concilia|, IV, pp 321-328; P.

913,1589 Feb 28 - March 8 ,two clerical subsidies ,Elizabeth I ,"In the parliament which assembled on 4 February 1589 and sat until 29 March 1589, a grant of two subsidies of 6s. in the pound made by both provinces of the clergy was confirmed.  The clergy of the province of Canterbury had devoted five sessions to discussion of the subsidy proposal, between 12 and 26 February.  On 28 February, at an extraordinary conference at Lambeth involving bishops and some of the lower clergy, agreement on the matter was at last reached, and the text was submitted to parliament for ratification, even though the clergy of York province did not give their assent until 8 March 1589.Each subsidy of 6s. in the pound was to be levied over three years, as a tax of 2s. in the pound in each year, the second subsidy being levied at the conclusion of the first.  The grant, therefore, was in effect an annual subsidy of 2s. in the pound for six years.  Payment of the first subsidy was not to begin until after the last payment of the subsidy granted in 1587.As before, the subsidies were to be levied on income from all manner of benefices and clerical offices, and paid by every archbishop, bishop, dean, archdeacon, prebendary, provost, master of college, master of hospital, parson, vicar and all other members of the clergy enjoying any spiritual promotion or other temporal possessions annexed to the same spiritual promotions. Parsons, vicars and other clergy whose benefices were valued at less than £6 13s. 4d. per annum were wholly exempt. Vicars whose benefices were valued at less than £8 per annum were also wholly exempt, and vicars whose benefices were valued at between £8 and £10 per annum were to pay only 6s. 8d. in each year.  Only benefices worth more than £10 per annum, therefore, were to pay the rate of 2s. in the pound in each year.The subsidies were to be levied according to the valuation made for first fruits and tenths, with deduction made for payment of the tenth part of their income, under the act of first fruits and tenths. The clergy were to be taxed for the subsidies, therefore, on nine-tenths of their income. No one promoted to a benefice or office between 2 October 1590 and 2 October 1596, and liable to pay first fruits, was to pay the subsidies. Allowable deductions from the taxable value of new bishoprics, deaneries, cathedral or collegiate churches, or colleges, etc. were whatever portions of their revenue had been given for the maintenance of poor men, school masters, ushers, grammarians, choristers, petty canons, vicars choral, readers of divinity, singing men, vergers and other necessary and daily officers or ministers, and the expenses of rebuilding or repairing of any cathedral or collegiate churches or colleges. These deductions were to be certified to the Exchequer, upon due search and examination by the bishop or archbishop (or by the dean and chapter, in the event of a vacant see), by 22 January each year.Exempt from payment of the subsidies were any benefices, almshouses, hospitals or grammar schools belonging to any college within the universities of Oxford or Cambridge, the college of Westminster, to Eton College or Winchester College, any poor men, women or children living on alms in any hospitals, almshouses or alms halls, or any benefices liable to pay fifteenths or other lay subsidies. No cathedrals, churches or other ecclesiastical places which had previously been charged with maintaining anniversaries, obits, lights, lamps etc. in chantries, which were now in the queen\'s hands, were to pay any tax on any part or portion of income from such chantries to which the queen was now entitled or possessed of, but were to have deduction and allowance made to them in their assessment for the subsidy accordingly. The same was to be true of concealed lands, which had previously been in the hands of cathedrals or churches, but were no longer in their possession.

Anyone else liable to pay the subsidies who was also charged with paying pensions to the ex-religious were to be allowed to retain the 2s. in the pound in each of the six years, to his own relief. Those pensioners paid their pensions at the Exchequer were to have the tax withheld at the Exchequer. Lay farmers or other lessees of forms of spiritual income were likewise liable to pay the subsidies on behalf of their landlords, unless they could produce any writings, covenants or bonds that showed otherwise. Spiritual possessions were not subject to payment of fifteenths or other taxes granted by the laity, however.  As before, unbeneficed clergy in receipt of an annual stipend of £8 or more were to pay a flat rate of 6s.8d. per annum in each of the six years. Should any such clergy default in payment of the tax, their employer, whether a parson, vicar or lay person, would be liable for the tax, and would be allowed to withhold the wages of the defaulter to recover the sum owed.The subsidies were to be collected by the bishops and their appointees in every diocese, or by the dean and chapter in the case of a vacant see.

914,1593 April 2 or earlier ,two clerical subsidies ,Elizabeth I ,"The clergy of the province of Canterbury assembled in convocation at St. Paul\'s, London, on 20 February 1593, and continued to meet until the assembly was prorogued until 17 March.  They granted the queen two subsidies of 4s. in the pound each, some time before 2 April, when the clergy of York province met in convocation and assented to the same grant in the same terms.  The grant was confirmed in the parliament that sat between 19 February and 10 April 1593.The two subsidies were to be levied simultaneously, at the rate of 4s. in the pound, over four years.  The combined tax paid for both subsidies, therefore, was the usual 2s. in the pound each year.  As before, the subsidies were to be levied on income from all manner of benefices and clerical offices, and paid by every archbishop, bishop, dean, archdeacon, prebendary, provost, master of college, master of hospital, parson, vicar and all other members of the clergy enjoying any spiritual promotion or other temporal possessions annexed to the same spiritual promotions.  Parsons, vicars and other clergy whose benefices were valued at less than £6 13s.4d. per annum were wholly exempt.  Vicars whose benefices were valued at less than £8 per annum were also wholly exempt, and vicars whose benefices were valued at between £8 and £10 per annum were to pay only 6s.8d. in each year.  Only benefices worth more than £10 per annum, therefore, were to pay the rate of 2s. in the pound in each year.The subsidies were to be levied according to the valuation made for first fruits and tenths, with deduction made for payment of the tenth part of their income, under the act of first fruits and tenths.  The clergy were to be taxed for the subsidies, therefore, on nine-tenths of their income.  No one promoted to a benefice or office between 19 February 1593 and 19 February 1597, and liable to pay first fruits, was to pay the subsidies, and anyone who had already been promoted to a benefice or office and had compounded for payment of his first fruits between 19 February 1592 and 19 February 1593 was to be charged only half of the first payment of the first subsidy.  Allowable deductions from the taxable value of new bishoprics, deaneries, cathedral or collegiate churches, or colleges, etc. were whatever portions of their revenue had been given for the maintenance of poor men, school masters, ushers, grammarians, choristers, petty canons, vicars choral, readers of divinity, singing men, vergers and other necessary and daily officers or ministers, and the expenses of rebuilding or repairing of any cathedral or collegiate churches or colleges.  These deductions were to be certified to the Exchequer, upon due search and examination by the bishop or archbishop (or by the dean and chapter, in the event of a vacant see), by 14 July each year.Exempt from payment of the subsidies were any benefices, almshouses, hospitals or grammar schools belonging to any college within the universities of Oxford or Cambridge, the college of Westminster, to Eton College or Winchester College, any poor men, women or children living on alms in any hospitals, almshouses or alms halls, or any benefices liable to pay fifteenths or other lay subsidies.  No cathedrals, churches or other ecclesiastical places which had previously been charged with maintaining anniversaries, obits, lights, lamps etc. in chantries, which were now in the queen\'s hands, were to pay any tax on any part or portion of income from such chantries to which the queen was now entitled or possessed of, but were to have deduction and allowance made to them in their assessment for the subsidies accordingly.  The same was to be true of concealed lands, which had previously been in the hands of cathedrals or churches, but were no longer in their possession. Any member of the clergy in receipt of a pension of £5 per annum or more as a result of the dissolution of the monasteries, hospitals, colleges, chantries, free chapels, fraternities, guilds or other incorporations was, however, liable to pay the subsidies on the income of his/her pension. Anyone else liable to pay the subsidies who was also charged with paying pensions to the ex-religious were to be allowed to retain the 2s. in the pound in each of the four years, to his own relief. Those pensioners paid their pensions at the Exchequer were to have the tax withheld at the Exchequer. Lay farmers or other lessees of forms of spiritual income were likewise liable to pay the subsidies on behalf of their landlords, unless they could produce any writings, covenants or bonds that showed otherwise. Spiritual possessions were not subject to payment of fifteenths or other taxes granted by the laity, however.  The threshold of liability of stipendiary priests was raised from the levy of the last subsidies, and a graduated rate was introduced.  Unbeneficed clergy in receipt of an annual stipend of £10 or more were to pay a flat rate of 6s.8d. per annum in each of the four years, and unbeneficed clergy receiving an annual stipend of £15 or more were to pay a rate of 10s. per annum in each year.  Should any such clergy default in payment of the tax, their employer, whether a parson, vicar or lay person, would be liable for the tax, and would be allowed to withhold the wages of the defaulter to recover the sum owed.The subsidies were to be collected by the bishops and their appointees in every diocese, or by the dean and chapter in the case of a vacant see.  Collectors were to certify to the Exchequer the names and surnames of all stipendiary priests chargeable to the subsidies by 14 July each year.  They were also to certify the names of all deputy collectors appointed.  The subsidies were both to be collected in one annual payment on 19 February each year, beginning in 1594, and paid into the Exchequer by the following 14 July, receiving an acquittance upon payment of the tax money, for which the collector was to be charged only 4d.Collectors were empowered to compel payment of the subsidies from any defaulters by sequestration of the fruits and profits of their benefices or offices, after lawful warning given to them, to release them from any ecclesiastical censures under which they had been placed, once their payment had been received, and to revoke all process made against them.  Collectors or bishops could sell goods distrained from defaulters, remitting the money received for them to the Exchequer.  After a first refusal to pay, the defaulter was liable for the collector\'s costs in coming, going and demanding the tax, and after a second refusal, he was bound to pay the fourth part of the subsidies in addition to the amount that he had been assessed to pay.  In the event of obstinate and persistent refusal to pay, the defaulter would be deprived of his benefice or office after due warning. Collectors were to be discharged of any amounts that they certified to the Exchequer by 14 July each year that they were unable to collect from defaulters, and the form and exact wording of this certificate was specified in the subsidy act.Within four days of the collector\'s arrival at the Exchequer with the tax money, the appointed receiver was to receive the money and deliver a receipt to the collector or his deputy for every payment made.  Auditors of collectors\' accounts were to hear and audit their accounts within six days after a request to account had been made, and were to give bonds to this effect.  For every default or delay in the accounting procedure, the auditor was to be fined £10, half of which was to be paid to the collector so inconvenienced and half to the crown, upon complaint made to the treasurer, under-treasurer or chief baron of the Exchequer.  The offending auditor was to be imprisoned until paying the forfeited sum.  All acquittances given by collectors to taxpayers were to be honoured at the Exchequer, and if they were not, then the offender was to be subject to the same penalties as above specified.  Collectors were to be allowed 6d. of every pound for the charges of collection, carrying and paying in of the subsidies, and were to receive an acquittance at their final accounting each year, for which acquittance the accountant would be charged the sum of 3s.4d. to be paid to the clerk for writing it.(|Stat Realm|, IV, pp 861-866 (35 Elizabeth, c. 12); P.

915,1597 Dec 20 ,three clerical subsidies ,Elizabeth I ,"The clergy of the southern province were summoned to a convocation at St. Paul\'s, London, on 20 October 1597.  In the session held between 5 and 22 December 1597, they granted the queen three subsidies of 4s. in the pound each, to be paid over three years.  The clergy of the northern province similarly gave their assent to this grant, and it was confirmed in the parliament that sat from 24 October to 20 December 1597.The three subsidies were to be levied twice a year, at the rate of 4s. in the pound, over three years, in instalments of 2s. in the pound each.  The tax paid annually, therefore, was 4s. - double the usual rate of 2s. in the pound per annum.  As before, the subsidies were to be levied on income from all manner of benefices and clerical offices, and paid by every archbishop, bishop, dean, archdeacon, prebendary, provost, master of college, master of hospital, parson, vicar and all other members of the clergy enjoying any spiritual promotion or other temporal possessions annexed to the same spiritual promotions.  Parsons, vicars and other clergy whose benefices were valued at less than £6 13s. 4d. per annum were wholly exempt.  Vicars whose benefices were valued at less than £8 per annum were also wholly exempt, and vicars whose benefices were valued at between £8 and £10 per annum were to pay only 6s. 8d. twice yearly.  Only benefices worth more than £10 per annum, therefore, were to pay the rate of 2s. in the pound twice a year. The subsidies were to be levied according to the valuation made for first fruits and tenths, with deduction made for payment of the tenth part of their income, under the act of first fruits and tenths.  The clergy were to be taxed for the subsidies, therefore, on nine-tenths of their income.  No one promoted to a benefice or office between 2 October 1597 and 2 October 1600, and liable to pay first fruits, was to pay the subsidies, and anyone who had already been promoted to a benefice or office and had compounded for payment of his first fruits between 2 October 1596 and 2 October 1597 was to be charged only half of the first payment of the first subsidy.  Allowable deductions from the taxable value of new bishoprics, deaneries, cathedral or collegiate churches, or colleges, etc. were whatever portions of their revenue had been given for the maintenance of poor men, school masters, ushers, grammarians, choristers, petty canons, vicars choral, readers of divinity, singing men, vergers and other necessary and daily officers or ministers, and the expenses of rebuilding or repairing of any cathedral or collegiate churches or colleges.  These deductions were to be certified to the Exchequer, upon due search and examination by the bishop or archbishop (or by the dean and chapter, in the event of a vacant see), by 14 July each year.Exempt from payment of the subsidies were any benefices, almshouses, hospitals or grammar schools belonging to any college within the universities of Oxford or Cambridge, the college of Westminster, to Eton College or Winchester College, any poor men, women or children living on alms in any hospitals, almshouses or alms halls, or any benefices liable to pay fifteenths or other lay subsidies.  No cathedrals, churches or other ecclesiastical places which had previously been charged with maintaining anniversaries, obits, lights, lamps etc. in chantries, which were now in the queen\'s hands, were to pay any tax on any part or portion of income from such chantries to which the queen was now entitled or possessed of, but were to have deduction and allowance made to them in their assessment for the subsidies accordingly.  The same was to be true of concealed lands, which had previously been in the hands of cathedrals or churches, but were no longer in their possession. Any member of the clergy in receipt of a pension of £5 per annum or more as a result of the dissolution of the monasteries, hospitals, colleges, chantries, free chapels, fraternities, guilds or other incorporations was, however, liable to pay the subsidies on the income of his/her pension.  Anyone else liable to pay the subsidies who was also charged with paying pensions to the ex-religious were to be allowed to retain the 4s. in the pound in each of the four years, to his own relief.  Those pensioners paid their pensions at the Exchequer were to have the tax withheld at the Exchequer.  Lay farmers or other lessees of forms of spiritual income were likewise liable to pay the subsidies on behalf of their landlords, unless they could produce any writings, covenants or bonds that showed otherwise.  Spiritual possessions were not subject to payment of fifteenths or other taxes granted by the laity, however.  As in 1593, unbeneficed clergy in receipt of an annual stipend of £10 or more were to pay a flat rate of 6s.8d. twice yearly (or 13s.4d. per annum) in each of the three years, and unbeneficed clergy receiving an annual stipend of £15 or more were to pay a rate of 10s. twice yearly (or 20s. per annum) each year.

The revenue collected each year on 19 February was to be paid into the Exchequer by the following 14 July, and that collected each year on 2 October was to be paid into the Exchequer by the following 22 February.

916,1601 Nov 30 or earlier ,four clerical subsidies ,Elizabeth I ,"The clergy of the province of Canterbury assembled in convocation at St. Paul\'s, London, on 18 October 1601.  By 30 November 1601, when the convocation of York gave their assent, the southern clergy had granted the queen four subsidies of 4s. in the pound, to be paid over three years.  The grant was confirmed in the parliament that sat between 27 October 1601 and 19 December 1601.The first of the four subsidies was to be paid in one payment of 4s. in the pound, and the other three were to be levied twice a year, at the rate of 2s. in the pound per payment, over three years, in instalments of 2s. in the pound each.

The clergy were to be taxed for the subsidies, therefore, on nine-tenths of their income.  No one promoted to a benefice or office, who had compounded or was to compound for payment of first fruits between 26 March 1601 and 26 March 1602 was to pay the first of the four subsidies, and no one who had been promoted to a benefice or office and compounded for payment of his first fruits between 26 March 1602 and 26 March 1605 was to be charged with payment of any of the second three subsidies.  Allowable deductions from the taxable value of new bishoprics, deaneries, cathedral or collegiate churches, or colleges, etc. were whatever portions of their revenue had been given for the maintenance of poor men, school masters, ushers, grammarians, choristers, petty canons, vicars choral, readers of divinity, singing men, vergers and other necessary and daily officers or ministers, and the expenses of rebuilding or repairing of any cathedral or collegiate churches or colleges.  These deductions were to be certified to the Exchequer, upon due search and examination by the bishop or archbishop (or by the dean and chapter, in the event of a vacant see), by 26 April 1602 for the whole subsidy due to be paid on 26 March 1602, by 22 February each year (for subsidy payments due on the previous 2 October) and by 14 July each year (for subsidy payments due on the previous 26 March).Exempt from payment of the subsidies were any benefices, almshouses, hospitals or grammar schools belonging to any college within the universities of Oxford or Cambridge, the college of Westminster, to Eton College or Winchester College, any poor men, women or children living on alms in any hospitals, almshouses or alms halls, or any benefices liable to pay fifteenths or other lay subsidies.

The bishop of Peterborough\'s letter to the council included a schedule of clergy from whom the £300 assessed could be collected, which comprised four higher clergymen, four prebendaries and 35 rectors, and the council provided him with the authority to levy the tax \'at his best discretion\' (|APC|, xiv, pp 54-55).  Similarly, the bishop of Exeter wrote on 22 April that he was not able to adhere to the proposed schedule of contributors, and citing authority given to him in a letter of the queen to re-apportion the total charge, enclosed a certificate listing the actual contributions of the clergy of his diocese.  The total raised in that diocese was £549 3s. 4d. (SP 12/188/36).  In the archdeaconry of Coventry (in the diocese of Coventry and Lichfield) individual contributions ranged from £5 to £12 10s., but most gave either £5 or £6 5s. (SP 12/188/33). Not only was the collection of the money less than hoped for, it also was gathered more slowly than anticipated.  By June 1586, however, £6,650 had been received at the Exchequer.(P.

642,1188 Feb 11 ,tenth to aid the land of Jerusalem - the \'Saladin Tithe\' ,Henry II ,"The capture of Jerusalem and other Crusader towns by Saladin following his crushing victory against the king of Jerusalem at Hattin in July 1187 led to requests to the leaders of western Christendom for assistance through a third crusade.  Henry II of England and Phillip II of France were warring on the frontiers of Normandy, but the archbishop of Tyre appeared at one of their peace conferences, near Gisors on 21 January 1188, and persuaded them to come to an agreement and to take the cross, signifying their intention to go on crusade.  Each then withdrew to prepare for their journey, Henry to Le Mans where, in the presence of a number of bishops and the barons of Anjou, Maine and Touraine, an ordinance was made for a tithe of rents and moveable goods to be collected in the king&#8217;s continental lands to finance his crusade; a similar levy was made by Philip.  On 29-30 January Henry sailed from Dieppe to England, immediately summoning his bishops, earls and barons to a council at Geddington in Northamptonshire, which took place there on 11 February.  Many laymen and clerics took the cross, following exhortations by the archbishop of Canterbury and the bishop of Rochester.  Then, with the advice of his leading men, the king chose clerks and laymen whom he trusted, and sent them to each county to collect the tithe according to the terms of the ordinance already made for his overseas lands.The terms of the ordinance made at Le Mans were that:(1) this year all must give a tenth of their rents and moveable goods in free alms to the assistance of the land of Jerusalem, excepting arms, horses and clothing of knights, and also excepting horses, books, clothes and vestments and all things of the clergy used in divine service, and precious stones of both clerics and laymen;(2) moreover, the money shall be collected in each parish in the presence of the parish priest and the rural dean, one Knight Templar and one Knight Hospitaller, and the king&#8217;s servant and king&#8217;s clerk, the baron&#8217;s servant and clerk, and the bishop&#8217;s clerk; excommunication having previously been pronounced by the archbishops, bishops and rural deans in each parish against anyone who does not bring the tenth legally agreed, in the presence of and with the knowledge of those who ought to be present, as stated; and if anyone to their knowledge has paid less than they ought, four or six legal men from the parish are to be chosen, who shall declare on oath the amount he should have paid; and then that amount shall be added to the smaller amount he had given;(3) moreover, clerks and laymen who have taken the cross shall pay nothing of the tenth, except for their property and demesne; and whatever their men owe shall be collected for their use and all returned to them;(4) moreover, the bishops are to cause it to be made known in each parish, by their letters, on Christmas Day, and the feasts of  St Stephen and St John, that each man shall gather together the agreed tenth at home before the feast of the Purification, and then on following day and thereafter make payment in the presence of those mentioned, at the place to which he has been called.The chronicler to whom we owe the most information, the Yorkshire parson Roger of Howden, goes on to say that the king caused all the towns of England to chose all the richest men (220 from London, 100 from York, and from the other towns according to their number and quantity), and made them present themselves to him on fixed days at specified places.  From them he took a tenth of their rents and moveable goods according to the new estimate made of them by faithful men.  Any of them found to be rebels he immediately imprisoned, and held them in chains, until the last farthing was paid.  He similarly treated the Jews of his lands, from whom he acquired an incalculable amount of money.   He also unsuccessfully tried to collect the tithe from William I (the Lion), King of Scotland, through the offices of Hugh du Puiset, bishop of Durham.  The tax was therefore to be collected on 2 February 1189 and the following days.  Three payments, for the honour of Tickhill, the bishopric of London and Leicester abbey, are mentioned in the pipe roll which began to be made up at Michaelmas 1188, but in sections of the roll which are likely to have been added sometime later.  It is known that some of the levy was collected at Salisbury by clerks of the treasurer and chamberlains of the Exchequer assisted by ten tellers, and from there carried to Bristol, Gloucester and Southampton.  Salisbury may well have been the main collection point.  The provision in Salisbury castle of a large hutch in which to store treasure is probably connected with the levy.  Gervase of Canterbury estimated the yield of the tax in England as £70,000 from Christians and £60,000 from Jews, but this must have been an exaggeration.  There are no surviving returns or enrolled account, but an enrolled account was probably kept, being apparently cross-referred to as the &#8216;compotus de decimis&#8217; in the pipe roll made up in 1189.The levy of the tax and protests against it were recorded in the chronicles or writings of Ralph of Diss, Ralph of Coggeshall, Gervase of Canterbury, William of Newburgh, Geoffrey of Coldingham and Gerald of Wales, as well as by Howden himself.  In the end Henry died before he could undertake the crusade, and it was his son and successor Richard I who benefitted from the collection of the tax and went went on crusade in 1190; Roger of Howden was one of those who went with him.(|Gesta Regis Henrici Secundi Benedicti Abbatis|, ed W Stubbs (2 vols, Rolls Series, 1867), II, pp 30-33, 44, 59;  shorter version in |Chronica Magistri Rogeri de Houedene|, ed W Stubbs (4 vols, Rolls Series, 1868-71), II, pp 335-339; the text also given by William of Newburgh in his &#8216;Historia Rerum Anglicarum&#8217;, in |Chronicles and Memorials of the Reigns of Stephen, Henry II and Richard I|, ed R Howlett (4 vols, Rolls Series, 1884-90), I, pp 273-275; |The Historical Works of Gervase of Canterbury|, ed W Stubbs, (2 vols, Rolls Series, 1879-80), I, p 422;  |Pipe Roll 34 Henry II|, Pipe Roll Society, XXXVIII (1925), pp 11, 14, 216; |Pipe Roll 1 Richard I|, Record Commission (1844), pp 105-6, 178.

All that is known about it comes from a passage in the chronicle of Ralph of Diceto.  According to him, Pope Alexander III sent Nicholas, a subdeacon of the Roman church, to England to collect a subsidy from the archbishops, bishops, abbots, abbesses, priors and prelates to aid the church \'labouring in a schism\'.

Two years later he began to seek funds from lay rulers to help him regain power.  In the first half of 1184, when King Henry II was in Normandy, the pope sent nuncios to him asking for the grant of an aid from the English clergy.  The bishops then met in council and decided that such a grant would set a dangerous precedent, but did not object to making a one-off gift to the pope and advised the king to make such a gift, undertaking to reimburse him.  The king thus presented a large sum of money to the pope, apparently before his return to England on 10 June.  There is no record that the king was reimbursed, but it seems likely to have taken place.(Lunt, |Financial Relations of the Papacy with England to 1327|, pp 176-177; W E Lunt, \'The Text of the Ordinance of 1184 Concerning an Aid for the Holy Land\', |EHR|, XXXVII (1922), pp 235-242) ",Origin  Granted,

Baldwin, archbishop of Canterbury, ordered his suffragans to collect a tax in each parish, probably levied upon both clergy and laymen, for the king\'s reimbursement.

1,1269 Aug 7 or earlier x c. 1270 Aug 20 ,twentieth in aid of crusades on the laity and clergy ,Henry III ,"This twentieth was levied to supply money for a crusade made by Prince Edward in 1270.Some time before 7 August 1269, the lay and clerical tenants in chief granted a twentieth of all personal property on all lands of lay tenants in chief, and on the lands which the clergy held by knight\'s service.Towards the end of April 1270, the bishops and heads of religious houses agreed that the tax should be paid on their demesne lands.  This grant by the prelates was not to form a precedent; the receipts were to be devoted only to the crusade and were to be held on deposit until the king or his son departed.In October 1269 the beneficed clergy and abbots and priors of the province of Canterbury refused to concede the twentieth, but at some time in 1270 the bishops agreed that the property of the churches should pay a levy and to this the beneficed clergy later assented.The twentieth was also collected on the royal demesne, apparently by virtue of the grant made by the tenants in chief.  Towns often compounded for it, so that in effect they paid a tallage, a customary due.The complete account of the tax was not rendered until 1273 but much of the money had been paid before Prince Edward set out on 20 August 1270.  Although the assessments were to have begun on the morrow of Michaelmas (30 September) 1269, a writ of liberate dated 24 January 1273, authorising the payment of the expenses of one of the assessors, suggests that assessments were still being made after the accession of Edward I.  The complete account was not rendered until 1273, when it is said to have yielded almost £31,500.Before Edward\'s departure, Henry III granted him 6,000 marks from the tallage of the Jews to finance the crusade; the date of this tallage has not been established.(|Parl.

15,1217 Oct 20 x 30 ,scutage ,Henry III ,"Mitchell states that in order to help pay off the indemnity of 10,000 marks owing to Prince Louis, an aid was granted at a great council held on 20 Oct 1217, in the form of a scutage at the rate of 2 marks per fee (p. 125).  Writs concerning the collection were sent out on 30 Oct.  The payment dates cited in both letters close and letters patent were the feasts of St. Andrew next (30 November 1217) and of St. Hillary next (13 January 1218), the sum owed being due in two equal payments. In addition, an `aid\' was asked of the king\'s knights in Ireland.Only about half the liable fees were charged, and less than half the sum charged was actually paid - omissions and evasions abounded.  David Carpenter, citing 2 February as the second payment date, says that almost nothing had been paid into the Exchequer by August 1218, because the minority government lacked the power to enforce payment of the scutage by the great barons (or anybody else, for that matter).

16,1220 Aug 9 or earlier ,carucage of 2s. ,Henry III ,"This tax seems to have been granted, by a council of magnates, because the goverment had difficulty in meeting its commitments: &#8216;because of our great neccessity and at the instance of our most urgent debts, and for preserving our land of Poitou&#8217;.  The writs for its assessment were issued on 9 August 1220, and the money was to be paid in at the New Temple on 30 September; the urgency for its collection is underlined by the need to borrow over 2,000 marks from the papal legate in September.  The procedure was for the sheriff to assemble the county court, which chose two knights to help with the assessment and collection.  A roll for each hundred was drawn up and sent to the Exchequer.  It was levied on ploughs which had been yoked at Midsummer 1220, and land previously cultivated but was then waste was not subject to it.  It was paid on the royal demesne, and on the land of tenants in chief, including their demesnes.  It has been shown that in the Oxfordshire hundred of Wootton at least that the vills were arranged in groups, each of which was liable for an equal or predetermined share of the total amount of the tax to be paid by the hundred.  Religious houses not holding by knight service paid an aid in lump sums to their bishop, who paid it on to the king, but the Cistercians and Premonstratensians were exempt and the Templars and Hospitallers seem to have escaped in practice (though the Hospitallers\' arrears of 2s. for Hinton Waldrist, and the Templars\' arrears of 4s. in Westcot, both in Berkshire, are recorded in E 179/73/1B, as are other, similar items).  Later writs of 7 September extended the exemption to the demesnes of all clerics, and of 19 October to all their military and free tenants, on condition that the clerics would themselves collect the carucage from them. Much of the tax had been collected by November.  The Yorkshire barons and free tenants objected to the tax because they had not been consulted, but did eventually pay a lump sum, and the barons of Lancashire seem also to have opposed the levy.  The men of Cornwall paid a large fine in order to avoid assessment.  On the whole the amount realised by the tax was disappointing, and enquiries were being made into its collection in 1237.  The carucage was accounted for at the Exchequer, and a separate enrolled account was drawn up, the earliest such account to survive for a tax, drawn up between 1224 and 1226.  There are therefore no references to the collection of the carucage in the pipe rolls, although much information about its administration appears in the memoranda rolls.  Some material for the levy survives in E 179 (73/1B, 73/2, 120/1, 122/1, 161/1, 242/29, 239/24, 239/241, 239/242; also E 198/2/10) and the Book of Fees, for eight counties, the honour of Wallingford, and the bailiwick of Windsor, and is printed in |The Book of Fees|.(|Patent Rolls 1216-25|, p 253; |Rotuli Litterarum Clausarum|, I, 428, 437, 442; |Royal Letters of the Reign of Henry III|, ed W W Shirley (2 vols, Rolls Series, 1862-68), I, pp 151-2; |Annales Monastici|, II, pp 83, 293; III, p 60; |Book of Fees|, pp 289-334, 1437-1445, 1446-1456; |Roll of Divers Accounts|, Pipe Roll Society, NS XLIV (1982), pp 16-19, 20-26; E 368/3-5, LTR memoranda rolls 5-7 Henry III; Mitchell, |Studies in Taxation|, pp 129-136; D A Carpenter, |The Minority of Henry III| (1990), pp 206-7, 223-5; A.

The matter had been in hand from as early as 3 November 1226 , but the first definite orders for collection were issued concerning the levy of the tallage in London before 22 December 1226.  Commissions for collections in other towns and royal demesne were issued in January and February 1227.In each county, royally appointed commissioners made the assessment with the assistance of the sheriff.  Many towns compounded. London was particularly heavily tallaged, paying almost half of the 9,000 marks charged, probably because it had not paid towards the fifteenth levied the previous year; Henry issued letters patent to the city, promising that this would not form a precedent.This was the last tax levied before Henry III was declared of age in 1227.(|Rot.

18,c. 1235 July 17 ,feudal aid for the marriage of the king\'s sister ,Henry III ,"Isabella, John\'s second daughter, and sister of Henry III, married Frederick II in the spring of 1235.  As she was not the king\'s eldest daughter, a feudal aid was not legally due.  However, a great council was summoned and since John had not asked for an aid to marry his eldest daughter Joan, granted an aid in the form of a scutage at a rate of 2 marks per fee to help raise her dowry.   One half was to be paid at Michaelmas (29 September) 1235, the other half at Easter (30 March) 1236.  Similarly, a scutage at the same rate was levied on clerical tenants in chief.  Writs for collection from these tenants were issued on 17 July 1235.  It is not known when writs for collection from lay tenants were issued, but presumably at about the same time.  In addition a \'|donum|\' or \'|auxilium|\' was raised from those clergy not holding in knight service, as a result of meetings with heads of religious houses held between July and September.  Each house paid a lump sum.  There were also perhaps contributions from tenants holding of the king by sergeanty and socage.The money was locally held in safe repositories; letters close dated 19 June 1236 refer to the sums hitherto kept in Old Sarum castle.  Not all the money was used for Isabella\'s dowry.  Henry III used some of it for other purposes, such as the repair of Winchester castle. Although writs of distraint were issued concerning those who had not paid from as early as 5 December 1235, the last payment of the dowry was not made until June 1237.Some returns for this aid can be found in E 198/2/13-18.(Mitchell, |Studies in Taxation|, pp 208-213; Chew, thesis, pp 85-86; |CCR 1234-1237|, pp 188-189, 268, 329, 361) ",Origin  Granted,"1st: 1235 Sept 29, 2nd: 1236 March 30"
19,1237 Jan 20 ,thirtieth ,Henry III ,"On 20 January 1237 the first officially-designated parliament met at Westminster, and the king, through his advisor William Ralegh, asked it for an aid of a thirtieth on moveables, on the grounds that his officials had mismanaged his income and because of the heavy expense of his marriage in 1236 and his sister&#8217;s marriage to the emperor, Frederick II, in 1235; her dower was in arrears.  After some opposition it was agreed, in return for the king admitting three barons to his council and confirming Magna Carta and the Charter of the Forest.  One of those who spoke was Richard de Percy, a Yorkshire baron who had still not yet paid his contribution to the fortieth of 1232.  In the writs authorising the collection of the tax the king specified that he did not wish the occasion of this aid to be taken as a precedent or be made into a custom to ask for another similar aid: &#8216;nolumus etiam quod occasione huius auxilii sumatur deinceps occasio vel trahatur ad consuetudinem petendi alias consimile auxilium&#8217;.The grant was made by the archbishops, bishops, abbots, priors and clerics having lands not pertaining to to their churches, and earls, barons, knights and free men, for themselves and their villeins.  It was of a thirtieth of the goods to be held on 15 September 1237, when the grain had been gathered.  As in 1232, poor men and women having no more than 40 shillings per year were to be exempt.  Included in the tax were grains, carts, sheep, cows, pigs, stud horses, cart horses assigned to cultivation, and other riches and goods, the wording being virtually the same as the list of 1232 except for the last, general, phrase.  Again, exceptions were the goods which archbishops, bishops and other clerics had in parish churches or prebends, and lands pertaining to prebends and parish churches.  Also exempt were all gold and silver, palfreys, pack-horses, destriers, rouncies, arms, utensils and vases.  The local machinery for collection was as before headed by county commissioners, but this time consisted of four knights and a clerk, except in Yorkshire, where the East and North Ridings had two knights and a clerk, and the West four knights and a clerk, and Lincolnshire, where Lindsey, Kesteven and Holland each had four knights and a clerk.  Four legal men were to be elected from each vill to make assessments in the presence of the county commissioners and, if they wished to be present, the bailiffs of the local lords.  They were then to present the details of the chattels of all those assessed, including their value, to the commissioners, and then collect the money and pay it to them with tallies and rolls of particulars, to be deposited in a safe place locally before transport to London.  The places for deposit, a castle or an abbey, in each county, are as in 1232 specified on the close roll.  The goods of the assessors were to be assessed not by themselves but by another four men from the same vill.  Unlike 1232, lay lords were not normally allowed to collect from their own men, only to have their bailiff present at the assessment if they wished.  The arrangements for collections on the estates of ecclesiastics were similar to those for lay estates, with four of the estate knights or free tenants making the assessment and collection.  Unlike 1232, dates for the collection of the tax, in two instalments on 1 December 1237 and 31 May 1238, were specified when the first instructions were sent out, and the commissioners were to begin their work on 15 September 1237.  The organisation created for the collection of the tax consisted of a central board for each of the three divisions into which the kingdom was divided, at the Tower of London, Nottingham castle and Bristol castle.  Each group included two royal servants together with a Templar and a Hospitaller.  On 15 December 1237 the sheriffs were instructed to transport the cash, rolls and tallies, under the seals of the collectors, to the most convenient of the three centres by 20 January from some counties and 27 January from others.  Some arrears from this first collection were being collected at the second, and half the sum due at the latter was on 19 May 1237 postponed until 13 October, in Sussex at least, at the instance of the king&#8217;s counsellors and because of the poverty of the men of the land.  By 1239 the proceeds of the tax were consolidated in London and the collection centres in Nottingham and Bristol closed down.  Money from the tax collected in Lincolnshire, however, was being transported to London as late as February 1242.An enrolled account once existed, and is referred to in the pipe rolls, but it has not survived.  The account was not made at a separate Exchequer, although by May 1238 the office at the Tower of London possessed a chequer board;  mention is made only of counting and gathering the money, not of accounting for it.  The account was rendered at the main Exchequer apparently in 1241; the Cornwall collection was being dealt with in Easter term that year.  A roll of receipts at Nottingham has survived (E 179/270/30) and a roll of receipts from the hundreds and vills of Essex (E 179/107/1).

Two months later, Clement responded with the grant of a tenth of the income from the spiritualities and temporalities of the clergy of England, Ireland and Wales for three years, and ordered his legate Ottobon to collect it.According to Lunt, the English clergy were probably not given an opportunity to ratify this papal grant, although chroniclers claim that the matter was raised by the king at a council held at Kenilworth on 22 August 1266 and at a convocation of the clergy at Bury St Edmunds on 9 February 1267.  The king is said to have asked for the grant of a tenth on the spiritualities and temporalities of the clergy for three years and an additional 30,000 marks, to be levied on the whole clergy, to help meet his debts; the latter addition was reportedly refused by the clergy.  They had little choice in the matter of the tenth itself; it was Ottobon himself who appears to have summoned them to the convocation, in which he presented the pope\'s mandate, although they appear to have registered their discontent at this meeting. Ottobon had in fact already appointed local collectors to assess and collect the tax on 15-16 January 1267.  The first instalment was due to be paid on Easter day (17 April), and the collectors were instructed to excommunicate anyone who failed to pay on time.  For the most part, the first year\'s tax was paid according to the 1254 \'Valuation of Norwich\', since there had not been enough time for a new assessment.  Once this more rigorous assessment, based on the true value (|verus valor|), had been made, however, the clergy were expected to pay the difference.  In a few places, the first year of the tenth was paid according to a new valuation.  In several others, the new assessment was made in 1268, and in yet others, the new valuation did not take place until 1269, but many bishops and religious houses compounded with the king to pay lump sums in lieu of taxation according to the new assessment, or in some cases, in lieu of the whole triennial tenth.Assessments of the estates of at least four monastic houses made in 1267-1269 survive in copies held in their archives, and these are printed in Lunt, |Valuation of Norwich|, pp 540-551.  Generally speaking, the difference between the new valuation and that of 1254 was an increase in value of from one-third to one-half.E 179/277/63 is a receipt for arrears of the tax given by a collector to the prior and convent of Anglesey in Cambridgeshire on 16 September 1269, which was undoubtedly part of the priory\'s archive until the house was dissolved and its archive came into the Court of Augmentations.  (It is one of many documents from the priory\'s archive now in The National Archives.)The total yield of the tax is estimated to have been between £44,000 and £49,000.((Lunt, \'The Consent of the English Lower Clergy to Taxation During the Reign of Henry III\', pp 154-158; R Graham, \'Letters of Cardinal Ottoboni\', |EHR|, xv (1900), p 102; Lunt, |Valuation of Norwich|, pp 103-105, 540-551; Lunt, |Financial Relations of the Papacy with England to 1327|, pp 292-310; R Graham, \'The Taxation of Pope Nicholas IV\' in her |English Ecclesiastical Studies| (London, 1929), pp 278-279) ",Origin  Imposed,"1st: 1267 Apr 17, 2nd: 1267 Jun 24, 3rd: 1267 Sep 29, 4th: 1268 Apr 8, 5th: 1268 Jun 24, 6th: 1268 Sep 29, 7th: 1269 Mar 24, 8th: 1269 Jun 24, 9th: 1269 Sep 29"

No fines in lieu of service were taken: this levy was strictly viewed as service or scutage; those holding lands on the Welsh border who did not send their military obligation were treated particularly severely, and had their lands disseized.

It was assessed by the sheriff in conjunction with other specially appointed officials.

46,1225 Feb 2 ,fifteenth on the laity and the clergy ,Henry III ,"The conquest of Poitou by Louis VIII of France in 1224 required an English response, for which large funds were required.  The justiciar, Hubert de Burgh, proposed a special tax of a fifteenth on moveable property, to which the clerical and lay magnates consented at a great council at Westminster on 2 Febuary 1225, in return for a reissue of Magna Carta and the Charter of the Forest.  Commissioners called justices were appointed in each county to supervise the assessment and collection, and in a few places actually undertake it; their names are all known from the patent roll.  The sheriffs were ordered to assemble the knights of the county before them on 9 March; four were to be chosen and sworn for each hundred or wapentake, or more or less according to its size, to go through it assessing and collecting the fifteenth, not in their own hundreds but in neighbouring ones.  It was paid by all men, by whatever tenure they held, on the fees of lay tenants in chief; men on the royal demesne, and in cities and boroughs; clerical tenants in chief, the property of all their tenants and those living on their demesnes being assessed; religious houses not holding by military tenure; and merchants.  By a writ of 29 March 1225 the poor were excused, following complaints, the assessors being told not to trouble about trifling objects, but ordinary laymen were distrained if they refused to pay.  The surviving assessment rolls show that considerable efforts were made to obtain an accurate valuation.Everyone except earls, barons and knights was to swear as to the number, quantity and value of their moveable goods and those of their two nearest neighbours.  If there was any dispute as to the value between a man and his neighbours, the knights were to hold a sworn inquest by a jury of local men to decide what was due.  The sergeants and reeves of earls, barons and knights, or reeves if they had no sergeants, were to swear as to the value of the moveable goods of their lords in each vill.  A roll for each vill was drawn up in duplicate, one being retained by the knights and one given to the justices.  Some people compounded by fines, including the Cistercians, Premonstratensians and Templars; the Hospitallers were exempt, but later paid a sixteenth on their benefices.  The Barnwell annalist thought that all four orders were exempt.  Exempt goods were also detailed in the writ. For all clerics and free laymen who were not merchants, these were books, church and chapel ornaments, horses (including riding, war and draught horses), jewels, vases, utensils, the contents of larders, cellars and haybarns, and grain bought to provision castles;  for merchants, arms, riding horses, domestic utensils, and the contents of their larders and cellars for their own consumption;  for villeins, arms which they were sworn to carry, utensils, flesh, fish and drink for their own consumption, and hay and forage which was not for sale.  The tax was ordered to be collected in two instalments, at Trinity and Michaelmas (25 May and 29 September 1225). The receipts, after they had been handed over to the justices by the knights, who themselves received the money from the reeve and four men of each vill, were to be held in a safe place in the county, such as a cathedral, abbey or priory, under the seals of the knights and the justices, until instructions were given as to where to send it.  By May that had been decided.  Half was eventually sent to Winchester castle in the custody of the bishop of Salisbury, the other half to Devizes castle in the custody of the bishop of Bath.  The latter was soon altered to the New Temple in London, because of lack of provisions and accommodation at the inns.  The two bishops, who were both barons of the Exchequer,  heard the accounts of the collectors and paid the money out.  There seems to have been a separate exchequer for the accounts, and a special office of receipt was open from 17 June to 13 July for the first collection, and from 29 September to 22 November for the second.   Most of the money raised, which in the late 1230s the Exchequer estimated at 86,758 marks and 2d., but which seems from the accounts, thought to be complete, to be only about £39,191, was indeed spent on the campaign for which it was raised.  Part of it was, however, still due in December 1226, and the enrolled account runs to 11 January 1227. A number of assessments for this tax survive in E 179/81/2 (Chesterton, Cambridgeshire), 242/127 (Aswardhurn wapentake, Lincolnshire), and 242/47 (Chalke deanery, Wiltshire), and are printed in Pipe Roll Society, NS XLV (1983), pp 1-106.(|Patent Rolls 1216-25|, pp 511, 512, 524-45, 547, 560-567, 571, 572; |Patent Rolls 1225-32|, pp 1-56; |Rotuli Litterarum Clausarum|, II, 17, 21, 26, 29, 40, 41, 42, 44, 45, 71, 73-75, 81, 99, 146-48, 152, 180; |Red Book of the Exchequer|, ed H Hall (3 vols, Rolls Series, 1896), p 1064; |Annales Monastici|, II, pp 296, 300; |Memoriale Fratris Walteri de Coventria|, II, p 257; |Roll of Divers Accounts|, Pipe Roll Society, NS XLIV (1982); Pipe Roll Society, NS XLV (1983); Mitchell, |Studies in Taxation|, pp 159-69; Mitchell, |Taxation in Medieval England|, pp 20, 37-40,  92, 139-143, 151; Carpenter, |Minority of Henry III|, pp 379-382; F A Cazel, &#8216;The Fifteenth of 1225&#8217;, |BIHR|, XXXIV (1961), pp 68-81)enrolled account: E 364/1, rot 5 (printed in Pipe Roll Society, NS XLIV (1982), pp 54-63, and in |BIHR|, XXXIV (1961), pp 73-81) ",Origin  Granted,"1st: 1225 May 25, 2nd: 1225 Sept 29"
47,1254 Jan 27 or earlier ,three papal tenths ,Henry III ,"In response to Henry III\'s decision to take the cross on 6 March 1250, Pope Innocent IV granted him a tenth of all the clergy\'s revenues for three years, which was to be collected after the king fixed a date for his departure.  The yield of the first two years was to be collected and delivered to him by the archbishop of Canterbury and the bishop of Hereford when he was ready to set out.Convocations of the Canterbury and York provinces to discuss the grant of the tax began to be held in March 1251, the bishops of both provinces being inclined to withhold their consent.  On 14 April 1252, Henry swore publicly to leave on 24 June 1256 and on 25 April 1252, acting under the papal mandate, he asked the archbishops to order collection to begin at Michaelmas.  Meanwhile the opposition of the bishops persisted, even though the king repeated his demand at a subsequent council in January 1253.  A further council was convened on 4 May 1253, and after discussions which extended over two weeks, the prelates agreed to grant a levy of a tenth of clerical incomes for three years, in exchange for the king\'s promise to observe the liberties of the church and to refrain from violations of the great charter.  The tax was to be paid to the king only when he set off on his journey to the Holy Land.  The grant was not yet finalised, however, for no moves were made to set the collection in motion, and the king left for Gascony on 6 August 1253, where he remained until the end of 1254.  It was not until a subsequent parliament was convened by the queen and Richard of Cornwall, acting as regents, on 27 January 1254, that the matter of the clerical tenth appears to have been settled, as reported by the chroniclers of Dunstable and Tewkesbury. The pope had meanwhile retained control over the process of assessment and collection and had been issuing mandates for collection since 1 September 1252.  Further detailed instructions had been given, moreover, regarding the process of assessment and collection.  The basis of taxation was to include not only income from benefices but also manors held by clerics.  The Templars, Hospitallers and Cistercians were all declared exempt from the levy.  The collectors were to keep the tax revenue on deposit at the pope\'s disposal, in order to safeguard it from being used for purposes other than the crusade, and were only to pay it to the king if he actually made the expedition.  The power to pronounce sentences of excommunication upon defaulters and defrauders was extended to the collectors.The archbishops of Canterbury and York and the bishops of Durham, Ely and Hereford had initially been appointed collectors of the tax by the pope on 30 April 1250, but by 13 November 1252 they had been replaced by the bishop of Chichester, and on 12 September 1253, he was joined by the bishop of Norwich and the abbot of Westminster.  Their appointment was approved by the king\'s council which authorised the payment of salaries for their work of 200 marks, 500 marks and 300 marks, respectively.  They divided the dioceses into three groups, each taking charge of one, with the bishop of Norwich being responsible for the largest number of dioceses, and perhaps being given a supervisory role, since the assessment came to be known as the \'Valuation of Norwich\'.  On 4 July 1254 they published their commission in London and the assessment was due to be completed by Michaelmas, when the payment of the tax for the first of the three years was due.The bulk of the work of assessment was carried out by the deans and three or four rectors and vicars selected from each deanery.  They took oaths promising to make just estimates and were instructed to establish the value of incomes from their own knowledge and the testimony of rectors, vicars and anyone else whom they chose to question.  They had discretionary power to compel any taxpayer or witness to swear to the truth of his statements and could excommunicate or interdict anyone defaulters.  All forms of ecclesiastical revenue were to be included, even the poorest church or hospital, and separated tithes, pensions and portions were all to be assessed.  Only income from property temporarily in the king\'s hands by reason of a vacancy was to be omitted.  To be included also were the clergy\'s \'temporalities\', that is, income from the manors, baronies and lay fees held by the clergy.The latter category of income proved highly contentious, and the assessment of temporalities was often omitted from the valuation, particularly in the case of large ecclesiastical estates.  In the diocese of Winchester, for example, the monks were still resisting the taxation of their temporalities in 1255.  Temporalities in Rochester were not assessed until 1256 and several of the bishops had still not paid their tenth in 1258.  The matter was raised by the king unsuccessfully in the parliament convened on 18 April 1255, and the protests of the clergy were given new vigour when the new pope, Alexander IV, allowed the king to divert the tax revenue to his campaign to procure the crown of Sicily for his son Edmund.  Pope Innocent IV had already allowed the king commute his crusader\'s vow for this purpose and extended the levy of the tenth from three to five years, and Alexander IV renewed the grant of the tenth in exchange for a large tranche of the revenue to help pay papal debts.Boniface, archbishop of Canterbury, and Rostand, a papal nuncio, were appointed as new collectors on 22 May 1255, and a new, more rigorous, valuation was ordered, arousing yet more hostility from the clergy, and it is doubtful that the new assessment was ever made.  Both sides were eventually compelled to compromise, but the pope would not yield on the taxation of temporalities, and the clergy were forced to give way on the point.  A number of new assessments of temporalities were received by the collectors in the winter of 1257.   The barons\' revolt of 1258 ended collection of the tax for a while, and although it had been resumed before 21 January 1261, the cancellation in early 1262 of a commission which had appointed English bishops as collectors of the tax in 1257 effectively ended the levy.  Only one assessment, for the diocese of Durham, survives among Exchequer documents (E 179/62/1), but several others have been preserved in monastic and episcopal archives, all of which have been printed in Lunt, |Valuation of Norwich|, 190-524. The total amount assessed in England and Wales, as recorded in the cartulary of the priory of Titchfield (in Hampshire), was £10,160.(|Councils &amp; Synods, A.D. 1205-1313|, ed.

48,1226 Oct 13 ,papal sixteenth ,Henry III ,"On 3 February 1225 Pope Honorius III commanded the archbishops, bishops, abbots, provosts, other prelates and rectors of England to provide the king with a subsidy in proportion to the incomes of their churches.  The king did not utilize the papal mandate until 27 May 1226, when he addressed letters to the bishop, dean and chapter, abbots, priors and other religious, and all ecclesiastical persons of each diocese, reminding them of this mandate, and asking them for an aid from ecclesiastical benefices not taxed by the fifteenth granted to him by the laity and clergy in the previous year.  The archbishop of Canterbury sent similar letters to his suffragans, urging them to grant a twelfth or fourteenth instead of a fifteenth.  Following a petition by the dean and chapter of Salisbury asking for a convocation of proctors from each church so that a uniform response could be made, the archbishop summoned a council of deans, archdeacons and members of the religious orders to meet in London on 13 October 1226.  It is not clear whether it was a council of the province of Canterbury or of the whole English Church.  No northerners appear to have attended, nor is there any record of a separate council in the northern province, but the tax of a sixteenth which this assembly granted, from the revenues of all churches, prebends and common property of chapters on which the fifteenth had not been paid, was levied throughout the land.The assessment of clerical incomes which had been made for the twentieth granted at the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215, and assessed and levied in England in 1217, was the valuation used to levy this tax.  \'Subsequently it became the invariable practice to levy royal taxes upon the spiritual revenues of the clergy according to the apportionment fixed under the direction of papal agents for some tax previously levied by the pope\' (Lunt, \'Early Assessments for Papal Taxation of English Clerical Incomes\', p 271).The pope\'s mandate had specified that the sums received were to be attested by the bishop, some abbots and some prelates, who were to assign the money to suitable men to keep it until it could be spent to the best advantage of the king and kingdom. The receivers were to publish accounts of receipts and disbursements.  The appointment of collectors was made by the council, which ordered the dean and chapter to collect the tax in cathedral churches and the archdeacons, assisted by men chosen by the bishop, to do the same in parish churches.  It mandated further that the first half of the tax was to be paid on 2 February 1227 and the second half on the following 6 June .  The king sanctioned the council\'s arrangements and by 1229 most of the tax had been received, but payments were still being made and being sought.(|Councils &amp; Synods, A.D. 1205-1313|, I, pp 155-164; Lunt, \'Early Assessments for Papal Taxation of English Clerical Incomes\', |Annual Report of the American Historical Association|, 1917 (Washington, 1920), p 271; Lunt, |Financial Relations of the Papacy with England to 1327|, pp 187-190) ",Origin  Imposed,"1st: 1227 Feb 2, 2nd: 1227 Jun 6"

On 24 October, immediately after the king\'s return, writs were issued directing that the scutage be paid on 7 December in most counties and on 20 January in others.  No fines were taken on this occasion.

The king, at a meeting of the council of lay tenants in July 1229, decided to invade France, summoning the host to meet him at Portsmouth on 14 October.  The expedition, however, was postponed until the following spring, and left on 30 April 1230.  The campaign ended when a truce was concluded on 6 September.  The decision to take the scutage was made at the July meeting of the council, but it was not put in charge until after the truce, the first writs to tenants authorising them to levy scutage from their rear vassals were issued on 11 September 1229.  This was the first occasion for some time on which fines (payable in advance by those tenants who did not wish to serve) were levied in addition to scutage, but as usual it was not customary for tenants to have to pay both. The bishops had not been present at the Northampton meeting and were called together at London in October.  They opposed the levy of the scutage but granted an aid of 3 marks on all their fees, receiving letters patent promising that the grant should not constitute a precedent, but adding that the king\'s rights should be neither decreased nor increased.  They thus seem to have been claiming they owed no service in France.  Religious houses which did not hold land by knight\'s service were also compelled to contribute.(S K Mitchell, |Studies in Taxation under John and Henry III| (London, 1914), pp 180-189; Helena M Chew, |Scutages and Aids in England, particularly in the Fourteenth Century| (unpublished MA thesis, London, 1921), pp 63-64; |CPR 1225-1232|, p 395).

Once again, those tenants-in-chief who fined in advance for non-service were not generally subjected to scutage.The clergy objected to it but between 6 and 14 April 1231 they granted an `aid\' at 3 marks per fee, the king issued letters patent granting that this should not constitute a precedent but, as before adding that his rights should not be either increased or decreased.

52,1229 April 29 ,papal tenth ,Henry III ,"On 20 December 1228 Pope Gregory IX ordered the clergy to provide him with a subsidy of a tenth of its annual income to finance his war against Frederick II, appointing his chaplain, Master Stephen of Agagni, collector of papal dues in England since 1227, to receive the tax.  According to the chronicler Roger of Wendover, the king summoned leading clerics to a council at Westminster on 29 April 1229 to discuss the matter, and this assembly reluctantly consented to the levy, although no other source records the convening of such a body.Stephen was given sweeping powers over the process of assessment and collection.  His deputies were to summon the archdeacons, rural deans, rectors and any others whose presence they desired to come before the bishop in each diocese.  The assembled clergy was then to swear under oath the number of churches in each rural deanery and their value (including all rents, revenues, crops, oblations, tithes increase and fruits of animals, and all incidental receipts belonging to them), although the bishop or any of his officials could contradict this testimony if they knew otherwise.  In the cathedral churches, three or more members of the chapter could be compelled by these deputies to attest to the value of the goods of the whole community and in each monastery as many monks etc. as they desired.  The deputies had powers of excommunication where false evidence had been given or in the event of any obstruction of the execution of their commission.  Stephen could depose defrauders of their benefices and reserve for papal provision benefices thus voided.  This change in assessment practice yielded more revenue to the pope, as several monastic chroniclers attest, although the total amount received is not known.  For the rest of the thirteenth century, therefore, the papacy followed these fundamental principles of assessment, although there were subsequent improvements in the details of their application.The tax was collected after 29 April 1229, but no known payment dates were mandated.(|Councils &amp; Synods, A.D. 1205-1313|, ed.

53,1232 Sept 22 ,fortieth ,Henry III ,"Early in 1232 Henry III was in debt, following his campaign in Gascony in 1230, and was borrowing heavily from the count of Brittany and Italians from Florence and Siena.  On 7 March he asked a meeting of the great council for an aid.  The earl of Chester, on behalf of the lay magnates, stated that they did not legally owe him any aid since they had served personally in France, and the king allowed them to withdraw.  The senior clergy asked for a delay because many of their number were not present, and the council was put off until after Easter.  It met again in London on 2 May, with no known result.  In the second half of September another council including the bishops, earls and barons granted an aid of a fortieth on moveable goods held on 22 September, just after the harvest.  The writs for its collection were issued on 28 September, and the assessment began within a month, the assessors being instructed to start work no later than 20 October.  No date was set for the tax to be collected; it was simply ordered to be collected as quickly as possible.  No special central organisation was apparently created to receive it. The fortieth was payable by archbishops, bishops, abbots, priors and clerics having lands not belonging to their churches, and earls, barons, knights, free men and villeins of the realm.  It was payable on their grains, ploughs, sheep, cows, pigs, stud horses, and cart horses assigned to cultivation in manors; excepting the goods which the archbishops, bishops and other ecclesiastical persons had from parish churches they had appropriated, and prebendal churches, and prebends, and lands pertaining to those prebends and parish churches.  There is no list of exempt lay goods, as on previous occasions, but the writ to levy the tax specified that nothing was to be taken from anyone who had moveable goods to the value of less than 40 shillings.The tax was the first entirely assessed by juries.  The local assessment machinery was set out in detail in the letter to the sheriff instructing him to assist, as follows.  Knightly assessors and collectors were sent to each county, varying in number according to the size of the county, their names being recorded on the close roll.  Four of the better and more legal men of each vill were to be chosen who, with the reeves of all the vills, were to assess all men on oath in the presence of the appointed knight assessors.  Afterwards, by the oath of two other legal men of the vill, the assessment of the four assessors and the reeve was to be made, and separately written down.  A roll for the vill was to be drawn up, which stated which barony or liberty each vill belonged to, in whole or in part.  After all the fortieth was assessed and written down, a roll of all the particulars of all the vills and all the counties was to be handed over to the steward of each of the barons, or to the steward&#8217;s attorney or the bailiff of the liberty, where anyone had a liberty, if the baron or lord of the liberty wished and was able to collect the tax, and to distrain for it.  If he did not wish or was unable to do so, the sheriffs were to make that distraint, not to receive any of it themselves but to hand over the whole of the fortieth to the knight assessors in a large and secure town in each county.  For each vill a tally was to be cut for the baron&#8217;s steward or his attorney, or the steward of the lord of the liberty, and the assessors, and the money deposited by the assessors in each vill in a safe place in it, the assessors having their seals, locks and keys on it, and the sheriffs theirs.  As soon as they had finished their assessment, the knights were to send the rolls of their whole circuit to the Exchequer; when all the money had been collected from them, they were similarly to send their receipt rolls.  The money was to be kept in the places where it was deposited, until transferred to the New Temple in London at the king&#8217;s order.In order to speed up the process, the assessors were instructed to work in pairs, and to let the sheriff know when and where to bring the men of the vills before them.  They  were also told in which large town in each county the money was to be stored when collected, such as Holy Trinity priory, Canterbury, for Kent, and Chichester cathedral for Sussex.  For small or dependent counties, or linked pairs of counties, the money from both was to be stored in one place: at Nottingham castle for Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire; at Sherborne castle for Somerset and Dorset; at Northampton castle for Northamptonshire and Rutland; at Carlisle castle for Cumberland and Westmorland; at the Tower of London for Essex, Hertfordshire and Middlesex; at York and Lincoln cathedrals for all the ridings of Yorkshire and the parts of Lincolnshire respectively. Some complaints  that the justices taxed goods which were not liable, including ships, fishing nets, gold and silver, were received and dealt with in November and December 1232.  Exemptions by writ were sought and obtained by Gilbertines and the Lazarines, while the Templars, Hospitallers and Cistercians opposed the tax and there was a delay in their collection; in the end the first two compounded with a lump sum, while the Cistercians may have escaped altogether.  Major churchmen, including the bishops of Ely, Hereford, Durham and Worcester, the abbots of Reading, Ramsey and St Mary&#8217;s, York, and the prior of Wenlock, and a single great layman, Richard Marshal, earl of Pembroke, took advantage of the special collection terms for liberty-holders and paid the tax direct.  Separate sections of the account were made for the honour of Brittany, the lands of the bishop of Durham in Howden, and the abbey of St Mary&#8217;s, York.  As late as March 1235 assessors in Yorkshire were ordered to assess and collect the fortieth on the lands of the count of Aumale, the earl of Lincoln and Richard de Percy, and in September 1236 final action had still to be taken against Percy.  Various references in the Exchequer memoranda rolls carry instructions to distrain unnamed debtors in various counties.  The yield of the tax was estimated by the Exchequer at 24,712 marks 7s. 5d.; the sum given in the enrolled account totals £12,924, of which £5,855 were paid into the treasury and £6,486 into the wardrobe.  However, the account appears to be incomplete, since not every county appears in it.  Many of the county sums mentioned in it were transferred for final accounting into various county accounts in the pipe rolls, after the sheriff and one or more of the collectors for each shire had appeared before the barons with their rolls and tallies.A Kent assessment covering about a fifth of the county survives for this tax in E 179/123/1 and 2, and is printed in Pipe Roll Society, NS XLV (1983), pp 107-119; a village assessment for Stathern in Leicestershire also survives (SC 11/531) and is printed in N Niemeyer, &#8216;Assessment for the Fortieth of 1232&#8217;, |EHR|, XXIV (1909), pp 733-35.(|CCR 1231-1234|, pp 155-61, 283, 285, 287-88, 290-95, 297-302, 311; |CPR 1225-1232|, pp 473, 490, 501; |CPR 1232-1247|, pp 124, 159; E 159/14, rot 13; E 159/15, rot 14d; E 159/13, rot 7; Wendover, |Chronica|, IV, pp 233-234, 249, 254; |Annales Monastici|, I, p 87; II, pp 310; III, p 131; IV, pp 72-74; |Red Book of the Exchequer|, p 1064; Mitchell, |Studies in Taxation|, pp 199-206; Mitchell, |Taxation in Medieval England|, pp 20, 40-42, 58, 83, 92, 105, 143-145, 151-2, 200-201, 204)enrolled account: E 364/1, rot 6 (printed in Pipe Roll Society, NS XLIV (1982), pp 63-73) ",Origin  Granted,
54,c. 1231 Sept 25 ,scutage ,Henry III ,"The `scutage of Elveyn\' was levied for the Welsh campaign on July - September 1231 at the reduced rate of 20 shillings per fee.  On 27 June Henry ordered the host to meet on 6 July.  The campaign was over by 25 September, when the king was back in Hereford.  Those tenants who served were authorised to collect scutage from their rear vassals on 6 September, but the tenants who had not served were probably not charged until after the end of the campaign.  The sum put in charge was circa £1,500, of which only £828 had been paid by 1233.(S K Mitchell, |Studies in Taxation under John and Henry III| (London, 1914), pp 195-199; |CCR 1227-1231|, p 592).

56,1239 Oct 21 - 1240 Nov 8 ,papal fifth on foreign clergy and a clerical aid ,Henry III ,"In the latter part of 1239, probably around 21 October, Pope Gregory IX attempted to impose a tax of one-fifth of the annual income of the foreign clergy beneficed in England, and asked for the grant of an aid from the rest of the English clergy to help finance his war against the Holy Roman Emperor.  It is a matter of some debate whether the clergy had any choice but to grant the aid.  It seems clear, however, that the amount that they would contribute was their own choice.Collection of the one-fifth on foreign clergy had begun by 29 February 1240, when the king wrote to the pope\'s legate Otho, demanding the exemption of certain named royal clerks.  To secure the grant of the aid, however, Otho convened a council of bishops, deans, representatives of chapters and archdeacons at Reading in late May 1240, and other assemblies met over the summer, but it was not until 8 November that a council of higher secular and religious clergy agreed to pay the aid.  No single rate was devised, and although Otho had suggested a twelfth of their income, this rate was by no means the standard rate levied.  The higher clergy seem to have made individual agreements with the legate to pay lump sums, which bore no definite proportional relation to their incomes, while the lower clergy paid a fractional portion of their yearly incomes, which varied in rate from one diocese to another.  There was some opposition to the grant by the lower clergy, which paid only grudgingly.The tax was collected throughout 1240 and 1241, with the king assuming control over the proceeds which had not yet been paid to the papal nuncios on 26 July 1241.  Another papal envoy was sent to England to receive the money kept by the king in early 1244, and to levy the unpaid arrears.  The total tax yield is not known.(|Councils &amp; Synods, A.D. 1205-1313|, ed.

57,1242 May 1 or earlier ,scutage ,Henry III ,"The `scutage of Gascony\' was levied in connection with Henry\'s expedition which left for Gascony on 9 May.  The scutage was levied at the rate of 3 marks per fee, together with fines (payable in advance by tenants who notified their intention not to serve).  It was put in charge before the king\'s departure on about 1 May or earlier - certainly a writ to Richard, earl of Cornwall, authorising him to levy scutage in advance of the campaign, bears the date of 1 May 1242.  On 19 May, the sheriff of Yorkshire was instructed to levy the scutage and pay it into the Exchequer by 13 October.  It was `granted\' probably to the extent that the lords agreed on the rate and timing of collection.As in 1229, the bishops granted an `aid\' at the same rate in return for letters patent stating that this should not form a precedent with the additional note that the king was not thereby either adding to or derogating from his own rights.  The aid was probably granted in early May.In addition `|dona|\' were requested from religious houses as early as the great council in January 1242.  The collection was undertaken by special collectors and sheriffs throughout the kingdom and many amount were paid before the king set out.The levy of this scutage was difficult, and the final accounting was never completed. The tenants-in-chief had been reluctant to serve in Gascony, and were equally reluctant to pay the scutage. Their opposition meant that the sheriffs had difficulty in holding inquisitions to establish the location and tenancy of all knights\' fees, as they had been instructed to do, and on 29 October were ordered sternly to proceed as per their instructions unless they wished their own property to be seized. In January 1243 further orders instructed sheriffs to pay the arrears of the scutage into the Exchequer by 27 January 1243, and not to hold inquisitions into the lands of tenants-in-chief who had performed their service, and thus had permission to levy scutage on their own tenants to compensate them; presumably this was an attempt to diffuse some of the antagonism to the scutage.Further returns for this scutage can be found at E 198/2/21-27.(S K Mitchell, |Studies in Taxation under John and Henry III| (London, 1914), pp 224-239; Helena M Chew, |Scutages and Aids in England, particularly in the Fourteenth Century (unpublished MA thesis, London, 1921), pp 64, 68).

58,1245 Feb 23 or later ,feudal aid to marry the king\'s eldest daughter ,Henry III ,"The great council met on 23 February 1245 and was asked for financial support.  After much discussion an aid for Henry III\'s eldest daughter\'s marriage was granted at the rate of 20s. per knight\'s fee.  According to the chronicler Matthew Paris, half was to be paid at Easter (16 April) and half at Michaelmas (29 September) 1245.  The king promised to observe the charters.  The grant was made even though the daughter, Margaret, was still a child, as a compromise with his requests for money; she did not marry until six years later, in December 1251, when she married the king of Scotland.  An \'aid\' was also taken from abbots and priors not holding by military service.According to Helena Chew, the levying of this aid was a last resort for Henry III, since in 1244 and 1245 \'the Great Council persistently refused to grant a gracious aid\'.  In addition, the barons agreed to be charged only on the number of fees for which military service was owed, and not the number of fees actually held; because of the escalated costs of equipping knights, the \'service\' requirement was by now significantly lower than the number of fees held.  S.K. Mitchell estimated the total sum charged at just over £6,000, of which only £2,480 9s 4s had been paid by 1247.(Mitchell, |Studies in Taxation|, pp 241-244; Chew, thesis, pp 88-89) ",Origin  Granted,"1st: 1245 April 16, 2nd: 1245 Sept 29"
59,1245 Oct 28 or later ,scutage ,Henry III ,"The `scutage of Gannoc\' was raised in connection with the campaign in Wales which lasted from 29 August - 28 October 1245, at a rate of 3 marks per fee. Although Mitchell believed that the scutage was levied while the army was actually in Wales, it is more likely to have been levied afterwards, which was the usual practice, only fines being payable in advance. Certainly writs authorising tenants-in-chief who had performed service to collect scutage from their rear vassals were not issued until afterwards, the abbot of St Edmunds receiving permission on 26 December 1245, and others on 21 January 1246. One reference, to the abbot of Westminster\'s scutage, specifies payment in two equal instalments at Easter (8 April) and Michaelmas (29 September) 1246. However, of the amount charged, which was almost £4,000, only £756 16s 11d was received in 1246 and 1247.Mitchell regarded this scutage as especially significant, since the reduced service quota from this occasion onwards appeared to become accepted as the only quota for which scutage was due. This was to cause problems during later reigns, when the Exchequer attempted to reimpose the original scutage quota of the actual number of knights fees held by tenants.(S K Mitchell, |Studies in Taxation under John and Henry III| (London, 1914), pp 245-248; Helena M Chew, |Scutages and Aids in England, particularly in the Fourteenth Century| (unpublished MA thesis, London, 1921, pp 64, 73; |CCR 1242-1247|, pp 380, 385, 387).

60,1247 April 7 ,"papal levy of 11,000 marks ",Henry III ,"On 10 October 1246 Pope Innocent IV commissioned John, provincial minister of the Franciscans in Provence, apparently an Englishman by birth, to collect a subsidy from the English clergy.  He arrived in England in February 1247 and sought the king\'s permission to the levy, which was reluctantly given.  A council was summoned by the king to meet at Oxford on 7 April 1247 to debate the matter of the subsidy, and eventually agreed to a levy of 11,000 marks.  The exempt abbots had lump sums imposed upon them by John, for which they had to negotiate reductions with Rome.Each bishop was to obtain the approval of his own clergy of the quota assigned to his diocese, and was made responsible for the collection within his own diocese, with the help of his archdeacons.  The levy took the form of a tax on income on the basis of the assessment for the tenth in 1229, and the rate of taxation may have been a tenth or less.  The Hospitallers and Templars were declared exempt by the pope.  Italian clergy holding benefices or receiving pensions from England, however, were required to pay a fourth part of their annual incomes, if these were less than 100 marks, and half of their yearly incomes, if more than 100 marks.The subsidy was to be collected in equal parts on 11 November 1247 and 2 February 1248.(Lunt, \'Early Assessments for Papal Taxation of English Clerical Incomes\', p 278; Lunt, |Financial Relations of the Papacy with England to 1327|, pp 220-224; Lunt, |Valuation of Norwich|, pp 42-47) ",Origin  Granted,"1st: 1247 Nov 11, 2nd: 1248 Feb 2"
61,1253 April 27 x May 13 ,feudal aid to knight the king\'s eldest son ,Henry III ,"At the great council meeting which began on 27 April 1253, the tenants in chief agreed to pay an aid for knighting Prince Edward.  According to the chronicler Matthew Paris, half was to be paid at Michaelmas (29 September) 1253, half at Easter (12 April) 1254.  The levy was granted in return for the confirmation of the charters. The prince was knighted in 1254 but the aid on military tenants, though nominally raised for this purpose, seems in reality to have been levied to defray the expenses of Henry\'s campaign in Gascony in 1253, in connection with which the king\'s military tenants in Ireland were also asked to grant an aid or serve, and the clergy and towns were asked to contribute.  Probably for this reason, no scutage was taken. In connection with the same campaign, in addition to fines from military tenants, the king as usual collected contributions from religious houses, some of which did not hold by military service.Writs for collection of the aid were issued on 13 May 1253.  Henry III\'s demesne tenants were asked to contribute an aid, payable by Ascension (29 May 1253), not by 22 June, as stated by S.K. Mitchell, whose account, based largely on chronicles, is confusing.  It is clear, however, that the king\'s expenses were heavy and that he needed further financial support.In December 1253 he petitioned for further aid, and according to Mitchell, some time after Easter 1254, the lesser tenants agreed to contribute, after consultation with representatives from the counties.  However, a letter from the king dated 24 March (before Easter, which fell on 12 April), expressed appreciation for the assistance rendered and gave instructions for those wishing to accompany the queen in person to join him in France.  Those sending money were to ensure that the queen received it in time for her departure; this, according to protection letters issued to those accompanying her, was on or about 3 May 1254. What response there was in real terms to this further request is doubtful.  The barons were certainly sceptical about the king\'s needs, and in fact a treaty was concluded on 1 April, well before the queen\'s departure.(Mitchell, |Studies in Taxation|, pp 253-263; |CCR 1251-1253|, p 353; |CPR 1247-1258|, pp 229-230, 281, 374) ",Origin  Granted,"1st: 1253 May 29, 2nd: 1253 June 22, 3rd: 1253 Sept 29, 4th: 1254 April 12"

The subsidy was required for the purpose of discharging papal debts incurred, particularly those associated with the campaign in Sicily.  Each prelate was free to decide the amount that he would give, but the gift itself was mandatory.  It was the duty of the individual prelates to inform the pope how much he had paid to Leonard, who was to assign the receipts to the English agents of the mercantile firms to whom the money was owed.

This was assessed by the sheriff in conjuction  with special officials, sometimes royal justices, sent into the county.  Towns usually fined in lump sums for their tallage and thus obtained the privilege of making their own assessment and collection.  Persons and vills were also assessed by the justices.  Although the sum charged was c.2,500 marks, only 1, 613 marks were paid into the Exchequer, according to the Pipe roll for 2 Henry III.  Doubtless this was due to \'the ravages of war and the weakness of the king\'s authority\'. In addition, a tallage was taken on the king\'s demesne in Ireland.(D A Carpenter, |The Minority of Henry III| (London, 1990), p 67; see also S K Mitchell, |Studies in Taxation under John and Henry III| (London, 1914), pp 124-129; |CPR 1216-1225|, p 171).

95,1217 - 1218 ,"carucage of 3s., \'aid\' or scutage of 2 marks, and tallage ",Henry III ,"These taxes were levied by the council governing in the name of the minor Henry III, the carucage to raise money for the war against the invading Prince Louis of France and the barons who had rebelled against King John in 1215, followed by a scutage to help pay the indemnity of 10,000 marks which was due to Louis after he agreed to leave England on 11 September.  The carucage was also referred to as a hidage or aid, or &#8216;hidage and carucage&#8217;, or &#8216;hidage and carucage and aid&#8217;, and it was levied during the truce in the war in the early part of the year.  Despite the difficulties of making a new assessment it was still intended to accurately account for the number of hides chargeable in each county.  In each county the levy was made by a group of knights, known as the &#8216;collectors of the aid&#8217;, who were assisted by the sheriff.  A few major tenants in chief were allowed to make the collection from their own estates.  Very little is known about the tax, especially how far it was possible for it to be collected in the areas controlled by the rebel barons, because it was never accounted for in the pipe rolls, in which only a single unanswered debt for its collection in Berkshire was ever entered; that merely resulted from an order intended to assist the sheriff in its collection.  The Exchequer reopened only in November, by when newer taxes had been agreed.The later levies were required to ensure payment of  the indemnity due to Louis.  The aid on knights&#8217; fees, a scutage of two marks per fee, was granted by the &#8216;common counsel&#8217; of the earls and barons at a great council in London on 20 October.  It was granted to remove Louis from England, not for the usual reasons for which scutages were raised, with half the sum due to be raised by 30 November and the rest by 13 January 1218.  The writs for collection were issued on 10 November, allowing less than three weeks for the first collection, so payment was postponed to 13 January 1218, with the rest postponed until 25 March; in August 1218 it was again postponed to November 1218.  Many leading men were excused payment, while the bishop of Winchester refused to pay because he had not agreed to the tax, and his debt was later excused.  The indemnity to Louis was largely paid by April 1220, but the final payment was not made until 1221, through a loan from the papal legate.The writs for the collection of tallage on towns and royal demesnes were issued a day before those for the scutage, on 9 November.  It was assessed by the sheriff together with specially-appointed tallage commissioners, although some counties were omitted.  Towns which usually fined by a lump sum were allowed to make their own assessments and collections, but the collection may have raised less than those of 1210 and 1214.

96,1222 June 25 or earlier ,aid for the King of Jerusalem or subsidy for the Holy Land ,Henry III ,"This, the first poll tax in English history, was granted by the king&#8217;s council, at the instance of the papal legate Pandulf, in aid of the titular King of Jerusalem, John de Brienne, who came to England in the summer of 1222 seeking assistance.  Writs for its collection were issued on 25 June 1222, when it was referred to as an aid, and was to be collected before 1 August that year.  It was to be paid on a graduated scale: three marks by earls; one mark by barons; one shilling by knights; and one penny by free tenants, and those holding no land but possessing moveable goods worth half a mark.  Royal demesne tenants and the men of boroughs, and the tenants of clerics, were included, but the Templars were exempt.  A further writ of 24 November 1222 made two slight modifications, adding that anyone who cultivated the soil should pay a  penny, (thus including villeins among those liable), and exempting tenants holding only of religious houses or individual clerics.  Assessment was made in each vill by the chaplain and two legal men, and the sergeant of the vill, or the sergeants if there were several lords, who also collected it.  In boroughs, the assessment and collection was undertaken by two legal men of the corporation.  Any tenant who wished was allowed to assess and collect the poll tax on his own land; the bishop and prior of Ely certainly did so.  The receipts were to be held locally in a Templar or Hospitaller house and brought to London and deposited at the New Temple by 1 November 1222, where they were in the care of two citizens of London, Stephen le Gras and Gerrard Bat, appointed by the king and council.The original writ for the collection of the tax made no provision for sheriffs to distrain for payment, and about 3 November 1222 it was ordered to be collected without distraint, but in the order of 24 November cautious provision for distraint was made &#8216;if it should be necessary for assessing and collecting these pennies&#8217;.  The annals of Waverley stated that immediately after the grant was made it was contradicted, and that it produced little or nothing.  No mention of the tax is made in the pipe roll which began to be made up at Michaelmas 1222.  There was a further order for collection on 24 November 1222, instructing that the aid be collected before 21 December 1222, and that the proceeds were to be brought to the New Temple on 27 January 1223, in a separate sack for each vill. It was then to be counted, and a receipt roll probably drawn up.  Little seems to have been collected, however, and efforts to collect it continued in 1224.  On 12 December that year a further attempt was made to get the rest of the tax collected into the New Temple by 27 January 1225.  The disbursement of two sums totalling about 800 marks is recorded in the Chancery rolls in 1225.  The Exchequer made apparently final attempts to collect the tax in 1230.  The council then ordered the treasurer to direct the sheriffs to make enquiries as to who were the assessors and collectors of the tax, and summon them to appear before the barons of the Exchequer on 27 January 1230 to render their account and show the arrears still owed, bringing their rolls of assessment with them.(|Rotuli Litterarum Clausarum|, I, pp 516, 518, 567, 593, 594, 630; II, p 21; |Patent Rolls 1216-25|, pp 512, 527; |Annales Monastici|, II, p 296; III, p 67; |Memoriale Fratris Walteri de Coventria|, II, p 252; Fine Roll 14 Henry III (C 60/29, m 12d); LTR Memoranda Roll 14 Henry III (E 368/11, rot 3d); Mitchell, |Studies in Taxation|  pp 141-2; Mitchell, |Taxation in Medieval England|, pp 19-20, 35-37, 67, 138) ",Origin  Granted,1st: 1222 Aug 1 x Dec 21
97,1224 Aug 15 or later ,carucage of 6s.8d. and 2s. on the clergy ,Henry III ,"This was the last of the series of carucages of the late twelfth and early thirteenth century, and was of a highly unusual nature.  It seems to have been levied on clergy only, although the chronicle of Roger of Wendover says it was levied on laymen also; he seems to have confused it with a scutage being levied at the same time.  It arose out of the siege of Bedford castle, which was being held by Fawkes de Breaute&#8217;s men in defiance of the king.  The Dunstable annalist says that at the siege the archbishop of Canterbury, Stephen Langton, and his bishops and abbots came to the king&#8217;s aid and granted him a carucage of half a mark on their demesne lands, and two shillings on the lands of their tenants.  This is broadly confirmed by the Barnwell annalist and Ralph of Coggeshall.

115,1246 March 24 ,"papal subsidy of 6,000 marks ",Henry III ,"Early in 1244, seeking tax revenue from the English clergy to alleviate debts left by his predecessor in office, Pope Innocent IV sent his collector Master Martin to England with a mandate dated 7 January, in which he ordered each of the abbots and convents of the province of Canterbury to pay lump sum contributions to him and demanded an aid of 10,000 marks to be levied on the revenues of the English churches.  Master Martin brought these matters before the prelates assembled in the autumn of 1244 for a great council of England, and again at three subsequent meetings of the higher clergy in 1245, but could not secure their compliance.The king, magnates and commonalty of England meanwhile prepared a petition against papal exactions for presentation at the forthcoming general council of Lyons, and the king prohibited the payment of any papal subsidies until the result of the petition was known.  The council was convened on 24 June 1245, and continued until the following 17 July.  Not only was the petition unsuccessful, but six English bishops (all from the province of Canterbury) who attended evidently promised the pope an aid of 6,000 marks from the English churches (apparently equivalent to a twentieth).There was much opposition to the tax from both the laity and the clergy.  A parliament was assembled in London on 18 March 1246, during which a number of English grievances against the Roman curia were aired.  The pope had meanwhile written to the bishops who had agreed to the tax, ordering them to meet within 20 days of receipt of his letter so that they could repartition the tax among the dioceses, and to collect it within the following month.  The bishops began to put the pope\'s mandate into effect, the bishop of Norwich issuing letters on 24 Mar 1246 authorising the levy, but when the king learned of this, he forbade the clergy to pay and had public proclamations made to this effect. The pope sent another mandate, demanding that the tax be paid by 15 August, and threatened to place the kingdom under an interdict.  The king thus withdrew his prohibition and allowed the tax to be levied.The tax was levied on clerical incomes and the sum of 6,000 marks was apportioned among the clergy in a manner decided by the papal collector Master Martin, probably in accordance with the assessments made in 1217 or 1229. That the 6,000 marks was the amount expected to be raised by the levy of a twentieth is clear from a letter written by the bishops who met later in the year at St Paul\'s to protest another proposed papal levy.  This referred to \'a twentieth [of] 6,000 marks\' which had recently been paid to the pope, and two chroniclers also referred to the tax as a twentieth (Lunt, |Valuation of Norwich|, p 35).  The letter suggests also that the tax had been collected by 1 December 1246, the date of the bishops\' meeting, but an acquittance for the substantial sum of 480 marks given to two local collectors on 25 June 1247 by the archbishop of York indicates otherwise.(|Councils &amp; Synods, A.D. 1205-1313|, ed.

Boniface, archbishop of Canterbury, had attempted to carry out a visitation of the province in 1250, which was strongly resisted by ecclesiastical communities in London and was opposed throughout the province.  A levy of two pence in the mark (that is, an eightieth) was made on the clerical income of the province to meet the expences of Master John and his delegation.(Lunt, |Financial Relations of the Papacy with England to 1327, I, pp 225-226) ",Origin  Granted,

He succeeded in securing a papal concession to limit the power of the archbishop to exact procurations on his metropolitical visitation.  This was effected by a decretal which defined more exactly the amount of the procuration, and by the grant of an exemption of the incumbents of parish churches from the payment of procurations.The second part of this concession was granted by letters of 5 June 1252 to the bishops of Lincoln, London and Worcester.  These letters gave them authority to levy a subsidy of 6,000 marks, the first 2,000 of which was to pay the debt incurred by the papal nuncio and the other 4,000 marks was a gift to the pope from all the non-exempt churches of the province, except for the churches and revenues of Canterbury - the price of his concession.  A levy of 6,000 marks amounted to a twentieth of clerical incomes.As chief administrators of the levy, the bishops of London and Worcester set the process in motion by ordering each bishop to ascertain, through suitable men, the \'ancient valuation\' of each church and prebend (probably the valuation made in 1229) and the estimated value of the temporal goods of non-exempt religious houses in their diocese, which suggests that these temporalities had not been assessed or taxed for the papal income tax of 1229.  They were then to forward these assessments to the collectors at St Paul\'s about 13 December 1252.  The bishops deputed their archdeacons to the task of compiling the assessments.  In Lincoln diocese, the archdeacons were expected to have completed their assessments by 13 November.The archdeacons were also placed in charge of collection of the subsidy, threatening those who refused to pay with ecclesiastical censures.  In Norwich diocese, the bishop commanded that his officials deliver the proceeds to him at Norwich on 24 March 1253, and monastic chroniclers agree that the subsidy was collected throughout the province at this time.

149,1404 March ,"subsidy of £12,000 levied on income ",Henry IV ,"Parliament opened on 14 January 1404 and in early March made a money grant to Henry IV of £12,000, which was to be levied as a tax on income.  The commons were not happy with this tax and insisted that it was not to be a precedent for any future grant of taxation.  In order to ensure that the tax would be only a one-off, granted in exceptional circumstances, they made it a condition that no record be kept of it.  Not only were the records destroyed afterwards, but no mention of the tax was allowed to be made on the parliament roll.  The money collected was to be reserved for the king\'s personal use, but, if by 15 May, both a naval force and an army had not been raised, the grant was to be cancelled.Each holder of a knight\'s fee, or part of a knight\'s fee, was liable to pay 20s., or a portion thereof, determined on a pro-rata basis.  On lands, tenements or rents held in socage or any other form of tenure, and of a clear annual value of 20s. or more, a tax of 12d. per pound was payable.  Those persons holding less than 20s. per annum worth of land, but possessing moveable goods to the value of £20, would be taxed at the same rate of 12d. per pound, but no one was to be taxed on both land and goods.On 24 March 1404 commissioners were appointed, together with the sheriffs, to hold inquests in the counties to determine those liable to pay the \'subsidy\'.  The collectors and controllers were named in the same commission, which was enrolled on a separate roll of the fine rolls (C 60/209A), and they were to pay the money collected to specially-appointed treasurers who would receive and disburse the money, and be held accountable for it at the next parliament.  Members continued to be added to these commissions up to 1 July 1404.  The treasurers, named on the following day, were Master John Oudeby, an Exchequer clerk, and three prominent London merchants, John Hadley, Thomas Knolles and Richard Merlawe.  The appointment of such treasurers was another manifestation of the distrust of the commons, who had no confidence that the money would be properly spent if it were paid into either the Exchequer or the household, and was to be repeated in future levies of experimental taxes on income later in the century. The money was to be paid in two instalments.  The first tranche, due on 18 May 1404, was to total £7,000, and the second, due on 1 November 1404, was to yield the remaining £5,000.  The subsidy was evidently still being collected in June 1405 when, in a letter to the king, his council expressed its concern that the many loans (detailed in the letter) raised on the security of the subsidy could not be repaid out of the receipts, which reportedly amounted to only a small sum.  On the advice of the king\'s justices, the council recommended that, despite the assurances given to the commons about the method of collection, Exchequer process be initiated to collect the outstanding amount.Although records of this tax were to be destroyed, some documents, including indentures made between the treasurers of war and crown creditors, certifying payment to the latter out of the proceeds of the tax, survive in E 101/43/38 Parts I-II (T. Kido, \'English Government Finance, 1399-1413\', Unpublished PhD Thesis, University of London, 1965, Ch. 2, p.87).  A stray from this group may also now be at E 179/364/123, recording payments out of the proceeds from the tax in Suffolk, a county not listed by Dr Kido as having contributed (Table XII, p.359).Although the tax was to be extended to those having property in the bishopric of Durham and Hexhamshire not normally taxed, it is clear from the list of counties to which commissions were sent, that Durham and other northern counties (Cheshire, Cumberland, Lancashire, Northumberland and Westmorland), did not receive commissions, and so presumably did not pay.  Of the counties, cities and other areas to which commissions were sent, only around a third are known to have contributed to the tax.  Dr. Kido estimates that total proceeds from the tax may have amounted to more than £5,000, but certainly less than the £12,000 expected; he suggests that the resulting shortfall may have contributed to the financial crisis of late summer 1404 (Thesis, p.87).(|Rot.

150,1411 Nov 3 x Dec 19 ,subsidy on lands ,Henry IV ,"Parliament opened on 3 November 1411, and some time before it was adjourned on 19 December had granted an income tax.  Every man or woman of whatever estate, having lands or rents to the clear annual value of £20, was to pay 6s.8d. per £20 worth of land held.  Lands and tenements purchased in mortmain before 20 Edward I were exempt, as were those purchased by the clergy in frankalmoin since then.  The tax was referred to as a \'subsidy\', and was an important forerunner of the sixteenth-century subsidies on income, although the rate levied was less than 2% of income.Payment was said to be due by 3 February 1412, but the appointment of the sheriffs, escheators and two other commissioners in each county to \'enquire the names and amounts of land and rent held by all men and women who should contribute to the subsidy\' was not made until 2 January 1412, and their certification of assessment was not due at the Exchequer until the end of February.  The commission issued to the mayor of Coventry was not received by him until 10 February.  The return for Sussex and Surrey cites 28 April 1412 for the issue of instructions from the Exchequer. The particulars of account for Middlesex cites 18 June 1412 as the date that a second writ was sent to the collectors, a commission having been produced 2 January 1412 (cf. E 179/113/65 for a similar example from Gloucestershire). Therefore, the collections must correspondingly have been delayed well beyond the due date mandated initially (E 179/192/41; E 179/242/101; E 179/141/45).The returns for most counties, that is, either the assessment made or the monies collected, are printed in Volume VI of |Feudal Aids|.  Returns printed elsewhere include:  London (in J.C.L. Stahlschmidt, \'Lay Subsidy, London, 1411-12\', |Archaeological Journal|, XLIV (1887), pp 56-82), and Nottinghamshire (in S.J. Payling, |Political Society in Lancastrian England, The Greater Gentry of Nottinghamshire| (Oxford, 1991), Appendix 1, pp 221-226).  Three other assessments, which have not been printed, survive for Gloucestershire (C 115/K2/6682, fos. 37v-39), the city of Coventry (E 179/192/41), and Holderness (E 179/387/24).  Prof. Kido suggests that receipts from the tax totalled less than £2,000 (Thesis, p.89).The accounts of this tax were enrolled with those of the income taxes of 1404, 1435 and 1450, although the returns for London and eleven other counties are not included.

For each knight\'s fee 20s. was to be levied, and for every £20 worth of land held in socage, a tax of 20s. was payable; the aid was to be levied on a pro-rata basis for those with holdings of more or less value.  It was to be paid by 16 February 1402.  Two persons were named for each county, who, together with the sheriff and escheator, were responsible for assessment and collection, any two of whom could form a quorum.There are various indications, however, that the aid was not levied very successfully.  Henry IV was forced to raise loans to pay for Blanche\'s dowry, clothes and escort to Cologne, where she was married on 6 July.  The levy itself may have been delayed; a second order to commissioners in Cumberland to collect the aid was not issued until 1 December 1406, when the collection date of 17 February 1407 was given.A copy of the assessments made for the levy of this tax, together with the assessments for the last previous levy of a feudal aid (that of 1346 to knight the Black Prince), was compiled, copied, lavishly decorated with gold leaf, and bound into a book, probably for Henry V, and is now among the miscellaneous books of the King\'s Remembrancer, at E 164/3.

The money was only to be spent on the war; if measures had not been taken by 27 January 1405 to deal with the Welsh rebels and secure the Scottish marches, the grant was to be null and void.  The assembly also insisted that the grant not be taken as a precedent for such levies to underwrite the cost of defence, unless with the consent of parliament.  Simultaneously it granted an income tax on the wealthy.Letters patent were issued to named collectors for both fifteenths and tenths on 19 November.  The money was to be paid in three unequal instalments - on 25 December 1404, and 24 June and 11 November 1405.  The first instalment was to consist of one whole fifteenth and tenth; the second and third were each to be half of the remaining fifteenth and tenth.

The initial suggestion for the form in which financial aid should be granted - one and a half fifteenths and tenths, and customs on wool and cloth - came from the king\'s council in consultation with the lords on 21 November.  A delegation from the commons was summoned and told of the decision, and was instructed to ask for the commons\' assent.  The representatives protested that this method of obtaining revenue was to the \'grant prejudice &amp; derogation de lour Libertees\'.  The king had to agree that taxation could only be granted by the joint and unanimous assent of both houses, and in the established manner - i.e., by verbal communication through the speaker.  The commons insisted that a \'cedule de Indempnitee\' recording this concession be entered on the parliamentary roll.  Only after this had been done, and the speaker had extracted an assurance that the commons would be allowed to depart freely, was the grant of one and a half fifteenths and tenths made, on the last day of the session, 2 December 1407.The tax was to be paid in three equal instalments, on 2 February and 1 May 1408, and 2 February 1409.

A condition of the grant was that the clergy were not to be asked to pay the subsidy of £12,000 granted in the parliament of January 1404 on lands or possessions annexed to their spiritualities, but only those lands for which they normally paid taxes with the laity, and any money which had been collected from them for this reason was to be returned.Excused from payment of this tax were benefices of poor nuns and hospitals, and benefices in Wales and the Welsh Marches, as well as other benefices which had been destroyed by war or the sea, to be certified by the bishop of the diocese.Commissions for collection were issued with those for the traditional tenth on 17 May, and the names of the collectors were to be certified to the Exchequer on 17 June 1404.  The tax was to be paid on 24 June 1404.A royal receiver, the king\'s clerk William Dionys, was appointed to receive this tax from the collectors (E 179/363/165, 167).The total amount assessed on exempt benefices was £880, of which at least £633 was received.(Wilkins, |Concilia|, III, pp 279-280; |CFR 1399-1405|, pp 246-247; A Rogers, \'Clerical Taxation under Henry IV, 1399-1413\', |BIHR|, XLVI (1973), pp 129-131, 139, 143; A K McHardy, \'Clerical Taxation in Fifteenth-Century England: The Clergy as Agents of the Crown\', in |The Church, Politics and Patronage in the Fifteenth Century|, ed.

Convocation at last met at York on 2 June, when it granted a subsidy of a tenth.The tax was to be levied according to the |Novo Taxatio|, and the grant was made under three conditions: (1) that inquisitions and distraints carried out by royal commission, contrary to the liberty and ancient custom of the English church, cease, even in respect of temporalities and spiritualities acquired subsequent to the Statute of Mortmain of 1279; (2) that the clergy be declared exempt from the subsidy of £12,000 granted to the king in the parliament of January 1404; and (3) that the following exemptions from the tax be allowed:(a) benefices in Cumberland, Copeland (in Cumberland), Westmorland and Northumberland; (b) all nuns in the province; (c) the monasteries of Egglestone and Watton (in Yorkshire), Calder (in Cumberland), and Rufford and Mattersey (in Nottinghamshire), on account of their poverty; and (d) all benefices, prebends, portions, pensions and colleges in the province assessed at 10 marks per annum or less.The archbishop was instructed by convocation not to certify the grant to the king, or nominate collectors, until royal letters had been received agreeing to the conditions of the grant, and in the meantime, the clergy were to be excused any other exactions or taxation.The king\'s agreement to these conditions was given in a letter dated 11 June 1404, and the archbishop then certified the names of the collectors to the Exchequer on 5 October 1404.

A request from the crown to grant a tax to be levied on stipendiary chaplains and other exempt clergy was, however, turned down.The grant of the one and a half tenths was made under condition that the clergy not be burdened in the meantime with the payment of any other subsidy or charge, nor be harassed into attending parliament against their will.  No collector of the tax, moreover, was to be excused from acting as collector because of privileges granted to him by the king, and the moiety of the tenth (granted on 6 May 1404) payable on 1 May 1405 was to remain in force.Excused from payment of the tax were benefices of poor nuns and hospitals, and benefices in Wales and the Welsh Marches, as well as other benefices which had been destroyed by war or the sea, to be certified by the bishop of the diocese.Commissions for collection were issued on 6 December, and the names of the collectors were to be certified to the Exchequer by 25 December.

The northern clergy assembled at York on 11 December and sat for six days, but on 16 December the assembly was prorogued until 14 January 1405.  On that day they met again and granted the king a subsidy of a tenth.The tax was to be levied according to the |Novo Taxatio|, and subject to the following exemptions:(a) benefices in Cumberland, Westmorland and Northumberland; (b) all nuns in the province; and (c) the monasteries of Egglestone (in Yorkshire), Calder (in Cumberland), and Rufford and Mattersey (in Nottinghamshire), on account of their poverty, and Holm Cultram (in Cumberland), which had recently been burnt by the Scots.As a one-off concession, the customary exemption from the tax of all benefices, prebends, portions, pensions and colleges in the province, assessed at 10 marks per annum or less, would be waived, and these sources of clerical income would be held liable to pay the tax.  It was stressed, however, that this concession was not to be taken as a precedent.  The clergy was not to be subjected to any additional exactions or subsidy during the term of this present grant, but the collection of the tax granted at the convocation of June 1404 would still go ahead, and the present tax granted was not to be paid before the previous tenth had been collected.Commissions for collection had been issued by 31 January 1405, when the archbishop of York certified the names of the collectors.

768,1406 June 16 ,subsidy from unassessed clergy in Canterbury province ,Henry IV ,"The archbishop of Canterbury summoned the clergy of the province to a convocation at St. Paul\'s, London, on 26 April 1406.  It was promptly prorogued to 10 May, when it re-assembled, but was thereafter adjourned a number of times.  Finally, on 16 June the southern clergy granted the king both a tenth and a subsidy from those members of the clergy who did not pay the tenth.A subsidy of 6s.8d. was to be collected from (a) every chaplain who received a stipend or salary, both religious and secular, and including mendicant friars; (b) every chaplain or warden of a chantry; and (c) all beneficed clergy who were unaccustomed to pay tenths (that is, holders of benefices that were not assessed in the |Taxatio| of 1291), including vicars and rectors of churches and parsonages, and cathedral and collegiate churches.The grant of this tax was under these conditions: that no collector be excused from acting as collector because of any immunity, liberty or royal privilege granted to him; that all the proceeds of the tax were to be applied to the defence of the realm and the church of England, by the advice of the king\'s council; that the grant was not to be used as a precedent, and that no collectors were to be compelled to make payment at the Exchequer before the date set for payment. Commissions for collection were issued on 17 June 1406, and the names of the collectors were to be certified to the Exchequer on 1 July.  The tax was to be paid on 8 July 1406.On 21 June 1406 the collectors were ordered to collect the tax from the many members of the clergy who had reportedly retired to abbeys, priories and religious houses, cathedral and collegiate churches, and other exempt and privileged places so as to avoid paying the tax.  They were to make this collection upon the information and oaths of the abbots, priors, deans, wardens and governors of these exempt places, or in other lawful ways and means.  On 3 August 1406 the king wrote urgently to several collectors ordering them to bring in their proceeds, under pain of £100, before 15 August.The assessments were returned to the Exchequer and many survive among the E 179 documents, although they vary in the quantity of information about the individuals taxed which they convey, even within the same diocese.  In the archdeaconry of Stafford (in the diocese of Coventry and Lichfield), for example, the assessment survives in two copies, and it lists the names of the clergy taxed in each church, but it does not differentiate between beneficed clergy and salaried chaplains, simply listing their names under the churches in which they served (E 179/15/74).  In the archdeaconry of Derby (in the same diocese), on the other hand, this information is given, but the surnames of the individuals taxed are not usually recorded (E 179/15/73).  In the assessment of the deaneries of Ely and Wisbech in Ely diocese, both names and surnames are given, as well as the churches or chapels in which they served (E 179/23/14), and the same information is given in most cases in the archdeaconry of Totnes (E 179/24/33) and archdeaconry of Barnstaple (E 179/27/317), both in the diocese of Exeter. In Rochester diocese, both names and surnames are usually, but not always, given, although the churches or chapels in which they celebrated mass are (E 179/50/14). In the archdeaconry of Lewes, in Chichester diocese, names and surnames are sometimes given, but in other cases names (without surnames) are followed by what appear to be the places in which the priests served (E 179/12/106C).  A roll which is now thought to relate to this subsidy for the archdeaconry of Cornwall in the diocese of Exeter gives names and surnames of some individuals, but by no means all (E 179/25/183).

Following the lead of their southern counterparts, they granted the king a tenth on both assessed and unassessed benefices and a subsidy from unbeneficed clergy. A condition of the grant was that the proceeds of the subsidy were to be spent and applied wholly to the defence of the church and the realm, upon the advice and deliberation of the king\'s council.Beneficed clergy unaccustomed to pay tenths (that is, holders of benefices that were not assessed in the |Taxatio| of 1291 or |Novo Taxatio|), including vicars and rectors of churches and parsonages, and cathedral and collegiate churches were to be asked to pay a clerical tenth for the first time. The value of their annual income was to be assessed and they were to pay one tenth of two-thirds of the value of their benefices, prebends or dignities. In the event that the tenth part of this value proved to be less than 6s.8d., then each was to pay a flat rate tax of 6s.8d.A number of exceptions to the grant were made, with the following excused payment altogether: (1) the spiritual and temporal possessions of nuns, hospitals, prebends, pensions, portions, temporalities, and temporalities annexed to spiritualities valued at £10 or less; (2) all benefices in Cumbria, Northumberland, Copeland and Westmorland; (3) the monasteries of Cockersand and Holm Cultram, the greater part of which had been destroyed by the sea and the Scots; (4) the monasteries of Calder, Egglestone, Rufford, Mattersey, Watton and Felley, because of notorious poverty; (5) the abbey of Selby and its possessions, because of many grave, insupportable burdens; and (6) the lands and possessions of Meaux Abbey which had been destroyed by the sea, the Humber and other rivers in Holderness.The king was informed of the grant on 18 August 1406, and commissions were issued to the collectors on the following day. On 20 August the names of the collectors were certified to the Exchequer.The tax was to be paid in two equal instalments: on 1 February and 1 August 1407.There was a delay in the process of assessment, perhaps due in part to a vacancy in the see of York, and on 12 July 1407 the king was forced to write to the keeper of the spiritualities of the diocese (the dean and chapter of York), asking that the valuations of the unassessed benefices be returned into the Exchequer, and certification of the assessment was not made until 20 September 1407.

It was not until 10 December 1408, after the archbishop himself appeared at convocation that the clergy of the north were moved to grant the king a subsidy of a tenth.The grant had been made grudgingly, and despite the levy being \'beyond their ability on account of their notorious poverty and many insupportable losses befalling them at this present time by inundations of waters and violent storms of the wind\' (|CFR 1405-1413|, p 140).

Otherwise, the grant would be void.  There was also a long list of exemptions:(a) all dignities, archdeaconries, prebends, benefices, parsonages and offices whatsoever of the cathedral church of St. Peter, York (i.e., York Minster) and the community of the same, on account of the necessary and urgent repair and construction of the fabric of the church;(b) the monasteries of Selby, Watton, Ellerton, Eggleton, and Ferriby (in Yorkshire), Cockersand (in Lancashire), Holm Cultram (in Cumberland), and Mattersey, Rufford and Felley (in Nottinghamshire), often exempted, by reason of their \'wretchedness and notorious poverty\';(c) the monasteries of Newstead and Worksop (both in Nottinghamshire), \'since they are situated on the king\'s highway whereby they are charged beyond their means by the coming of guests\';(d) the lands and possessions of Meaux Abbey, which have been destroyed by flooding of the sea, the Humber and other rivers in Holderness;(e) all benefices of nuns [and canonesses]; and(f) benefices in Cumberland, Copeland (in Cumberland), Westmorland and Northumberland, destroyed by the Scots and not yet repaired, to be certified to the Exchequer by the bishops (|CFR 1405-1413|, p 140).The clergy did concede, however, that the levy be extended, for this one time only, to benefices worth less than 10 marks per annum, which were normally excluded from payment of the tax.

Following the lead of their southern counterparts, they granted the king a tenth on both assessed and unassessed benefices and a subsidy from unbeneficed clergy.A condition of the grant was that the proceeds of the subsidy were to be spent and applied wholly to the defence of the church and the realm, upon the advice and deliberation of the king\'s council.A subsidy of 6s.8d. was to be collected from unbeneficed clergy.

Members of the clergy who lent money were to be repaid by a clerical tenth which had been granted by convocation.  Like the tax on which the loan was to be charged, the loan money was to be spent only in England.On 26 November 1419, therefore, commissioners were appointed in every county \'to treat among themselves\' about the loan \'each of them shall advance\'.  They were \'to induce all sufficient secular lieges of the king...to pay the loan\', as well as \'any ecclesiastical persons who will provide the king with greater sums\'.  The commissioners were to certify to the treasurer of England or his deputy the names and amounts promised by lay lenders by 24 January 1420.A second wave of commissions to raise loans was issued on 27 January 1420.  They were given the same instructions, but with certification due from some counties on 16 February 1420, and on 28 March 1420 from others.  Clerical lenders, who were to pay on 2 February 1420, were outside the ambit of these supplementary commissions.  The chancellor was to provide letters patent, writs and other warrants necessary for the lenders to secure repayment from the one-third fifteenth and tenth, free of charge.  Original commissions issued to the loan commissioners survive in E 34/1A and E 34/1B.These attempts to raise loans were not very successful; little money was received from them in the Exchequer, and in the following year the king had to resort to more desperate measures.(|Rot.

The needs of the king\'s military operations in France were such, however, that Parliament passed an act enabling him to raise loans on the security of the last instalment of the two fifteenths and tenths and two clerical tenths.The appointment of commissioners is not recorded, but that a major campaign to secure loans from the general populace took place is evident.  Despite the parliamentary approval, Henry\'s methods of obtaining these loans were a cause of complaint for one London chronicler, who spoke of his harassment of all clergy, regardless of rank, \'said to be in possession of treasure\', and of laymen.  This comment would appear to be borne out by a letter from the king under the privy seal to the bishop of Exeter dated 12 March 1417, who had been appointed a commissioner to raise loans in Devon and Cornwall, giving security for repayment from the half-fifteenth and tenth due on 11 November of that year.  The letter informed the bishop that it was not the king\'s intention that only rich persons were to be approached for a loan, but anyone who could afford to lend at least 100s. \'without diminishing his estate\' (E 34/1B).  Although the levy of the loan was unpopular, the receipts were high and there were many small lenders.  Between 30 November 1416 and 13 March 1417, 226 loans are recorded in the Exchequer, and in Easter term 1417, a further 286 loans were made to the king.(|Rot. Parl|., IV, pp 95-96; C.L.

Commissioners were told to summon before them all laymen and clerics, apart from those persons listed in an attached schedule who had already lent money to the king, and treat with them for a loan to be paid to the treasurer of England by 1 May (or, in some counties, 8 May).  They were also asked to lend money themselves.  Security for repayment was to be given, but the source was not specified in the commission.Although the chronicler Adam of Usk complained bitterly of these financial exactions, claiming that the king forced all men, both rich and poor, to lend to him, total receipts from both lay and clerical lenders, and including a contribution of £17,666 from Henry Beaufort, bishop of Winchester, reached £36,840 in 1421, the largest amount raised by public loans during Henry V\'s reign.A partial list of receipts of the second payment of the clerical tenth granted to Henry V in May (by the clergy of Canterbury province) and September (by the clergy of York province) appears to list the lenders to be repaid by assignment on this tax (E 179/278/2).

On 27 July, after the clergy of the southern province had met and granted the new king a subsidy, the northern convocation re-convened at York and on the next day voted Henry V a subsidy of a tenth.The grant was made under the following conditions: that neither the northern clergy, nor their famers, were to be compelled to pay a fifteenth with the laity, that the tenth was not to be levied before the payment date specified, that the clergy in the meantime were not to \'vexed by any assessments, subsidies, convocations or other charges\' (|CFR 1413-1422|, p 51).Those exempt from the levy were:(a) the monasteries of Ellerton, Ferriby, Watton and Eggleton (in Yorkshire), Cockersand (in Lancashire), Calder (in Cumberland), and Mattersey, Rufford and Felley (in Nottinghamshire), which were often exempted and still claimed exemption because of their wretchedness and notorious poverty;(b) the monasteries of St. Oswald, Nostell, Pontefract and Guisborough (all in Yorkshire), \'on account of their burdensome debt and the misfortune of fire for which they are not to blame\' (|CFR 1413-1422|, p 51);(c) the lands and possessions of Meaux Abbey, wherever they have been destroyed by floods;(d) all benefices of nuns [and canonesses];(e) the benefices of the churches of Acaster Malbis and Topclif (in Yorkshire), Kirkham (in Lancashire) and Misterton (in Nottinghamshire), which have been appropriated for the costly construction and speedy completion of the fabric of the cathedral church of York (i.e., York Minster);(f) all benefices in Cumberland, Copeland (in Cumberland), and Northumberland, to be certified to the Exchequer by the bishops; and(g) all benefices, hospitals, prebends, portions, pensions, temporalities, spiritualities and temporalities annexed to spiritualities in the province assessed at 10 marks per annum or less, according to the |Novo Taxatio|.Receiving exemption from one half of the levy were: (a) the abbey of Selby (in Yorkshire), heavily in debt; and (b) the prebend of Langtoft in the church of York [Minster], \'on account of its excessive assessment\' (|CFR 1413-1422|, p 51).

The payment date of the second instalment was later deferred until 24 June 1418, and then deferred again until 2 February 1420.  It appears that payment of the first tenth was subsequently brought forward to 24 June 1416, at least in the dioceses of Ely, Winchester and at least in part of the diocese of Hereford, as directed by letters issued by the bishop of Ely on 17 June 1416, these letters being cited in an account rendered for this tenth by the collectors in this diocese (E 179/23/29). The same payment date was cited in an account rendered for this tenth in Winchester diocese (E 179/55/54), and in the particulars of account of the collector for the archdeaconry of Hereford (E 179/30/36).Although collected by the same collectors, the two taxes were collected and accounted for separately.  An account for the second of the two tenths on unassessed benefices in the archdeaconry of Brecon in the diocese of St. David\'s, Wales, suggests that there this instalment of the grant was accounted for together with the half a tenth on unassessed benefices of 1419 (E 179/21/32); a similar account is extant for the archdeaconry of Cornwall in the diocese of Exeter (E 179/24/81).

This assembly sat, apparently at Beverley, until at least 26 January and apparently granted the king a subsidy of a tenth before dispersing.The terms and conditions of the grant, and those exempted from it, are not recorded.  From allowances in the enrolled account, it is evident that exemptions, or partial exemptions, from payment of the tax were extended to the monasteries of Ellerton, Watton, Meaux, Swine, Guisborough, Ferriby, Drax and Haltemprice (all in Yorkshire).The tax was to be paid, evidently in one payment, on 24 June 1417.  The tax had not yet been collected by the time of the next convocation, which sat from 5 to 12 January 1417.

The clergy sat for six days, at the end of which, on 26 January, despite a long-winded account of their poverty and dire circumstances, they granted Henry V two subsidies.  The second of these was a tenth on two-thirds of the value of all unassessed ecclesiastical benefices assessed at 8 marks and over.Both subsidies were granted on condition that the clergy not be burdened with any other taxes over the same period of their levy, and that the tax not be collected before the dates prescribed for collection.  The grant of the tenth on unassessed benefices carried the proviso also that vicars who were not assessed but who, according to the regulations and compositions of their vicarages, were bound to pay tenths with their rectors, in whole or in part, not be obliged to pay the tax on unassessed benefices.  The same exemptions from the levy applied as for the tenth on assessed benefices.  Commissions for collection of both subsidies were issued on 19 March, and the names of the collectors were to be certified to the Exchequer by 22 May 1418.  Both subsidies were to be paid on 2 February 1419.

The session began on 30 October and lasted until 21 November.  On 20 November, the penultimate day, the clergy granted the king three subsidies: half a tenth on assessed benefices, another half tenth on unassessed benefices, and a subsidy of 6s.8d. from chantry chaplains and unbeneficed chaplains. The subsidy of 6s.8d. was to be paid by all secular chaplains holding chantries of the true yearly value of 7 marks or more.  No chaplains who normally paid a tenth with the clergy or a fifteenth with the laity, or any part thereof, in respect of their chantry, was liable to pay this tax.  The subsidy was also to be paid by all unbeneficed secular chaplains receiving a yearly stipend or salary of 7 marks or more, or of 40s. or more and provision of food.  The assessment of the incomes of both the chantry and unbeneficed chaplains was to be certified by the relevant bishop.  It was provided, however, that no chaplains, \'who on account of their decrepit age or other notable inability are unable to help themselves\' were to pay the subsidy, with certification of their inability to pay to be made by the relevant bishop.  No royal writs or orders were to be issued, moreover, for the making of certificates contrary to those made by the relevant bishops, and the latter were to be allowed without difficulty at the Exchequer.  Another provision of the grant was that payment of the subsidy was not to be demanded before the specified collection date.  Finally, it was stressed that the grant of this tax was an extraordinary measure and would not form a precedent.

The clergy was accordingly convened on 13 January 1420.  By 18 January, when convocation dispersed, a grant of half a clerical tenth had been made, despite their inability to make such a grant \'on account of their notorious poverty and other many losses, expenses and insupportable burdens in unwonted measure befalling at this present time, and especially on account of the excessive labours and expenses that have often been necessarily and notoriously incurred in the past year against the Scots for the defence of the realm and the church of England, together with their heavy and almost insupportable burdens, their lack of money, the wasting of the crops through the dryness of the air, the destruction of cattle by murrain through the failure of the pastures, and the unwonted violence of manifold hostile raids\' (|CFR 1413-1422|, p 324).The tax was to be levied in accordance with the |Novo Taxatio|, subject to the usual conditions that the clergy were not to be compelled to pay any taxes with the laity in respect of their ecclesiastical goods, temporalities, spiritualities or temporalities annexed to spiritualities, on which they normally paid tenths, even where these goods were in the hands of farmers, and that the tax was not to be collected before the specified date.Exemption from payment of the tax was granted to: (a) the monasteries of Drax, Ellerton, Watton and Eggleston (in Yorkshire), and Mattersey, Rufford and Felley (in Nottinghamshire); (b) the church of Kirkham (in Lancashire); (c) all benefices of nuns [and canonesses]; (d) the community of the cathedral church of York (i.e. York Minster), for the speedy completion of the repair of its fabric; (e) the lands and possessions of Meaux Abbey, which have been destroyed by the waters of the sea, the Humber and other rivers; and (f) all benefices in Cumberland, Copeland (in Cumberland), Westmorland and Northumberland, and the temporalities annexed to them.Receiving exemption from one half of the levy, and paying thus only half of the moiety of a tenth, was the abbey of Selby (in Yorkshire), \'which is in many ways encumbered by debt and excessive assessments and also beyond remedy impoverished by the theft of a large sum of gold through a sudden raid by robbers at the time of the said convocation\' (|CFR 1413-1422|, p 324).Commissions for collection were issued on 27 January, and the names of the collectors were to be certified to the Exchequer by 25 March 1420.

The one and a half tenths on both assessed and unassessed benefices were granted on condition that: (a) neither the clergy nor their farmers be obliged to pay a fifteenth or any other contribution, imposition, grant, subsidy or subvention made by the laity to the king, or any part of the same, on the goods and possessions for which they normally paid clerical tenths, and that they shall have a writ from the Exchequer to this effect as often as they demand it, or as shall be necessary; (b) that if any collector appointed to levy the one and a half tenths certifies the Exchequer, on his oath, that he is unable to collect, or has been prevented from collecting, this tax from the alien priories or other ecclesiastical possessions, goods or benefices in the province, in whosoever hands they may be, even if in the hands of the king or one of the queens, or any farmer of the king, then that collector will be wholly discharged from making that collection and be quit at the Exchequer, and it will be left to the king and his ministers to collect it, and such collectors shall be no further vexed on that account; (c) that the king shall satisfy the collectors for the temporalities and spiritualities of cathedral churches and religious houses which are in his hands, or those of his farmers, or otherwise discharge the liability for them in the Exchequer without delay; and (d) that the taxes are not to be collected before the specified payment dates.Excused from payment of the one and half tenths on assessed and unassessed benefices were: (a) unappropriated ecclesiastical benefices with cure of souls, assessed and accustomed to pay the tenth, the true value of which is 12 marks per annum or less, in which the rectors or vicars, or others by whatsoever name they be known, have resided and do reside continuously in person, upon which the relevant bishop is to certify the Exchequer; (b) the priory of Blythburgh (in Suffolk), which has lately been destroyed by a sudden fire, and all ecclesiastical goods, benefices and possessions that belong to it; (c) all other ecclesiastical possessions and benefices of the province, that have been destroyed by floods or fires; and (d) all other ecclesiastical benefices throughout the province, which, on account of their poverty, are unofficed, upon the certification of the relevant bishop.Commissions for collection of all three taxes were issued on 31 January 1436, and the names of the collectors were to be certified to the Exchequer by 24 February 1436.

151,1433 Oct 13 x c. Dec 18 ,fifteenth and tenth ,Henry VI ,"Parliament opened on 8 July 1433, but was prorogued on 13 August until 13 October, without making a financial grant.  In the second session, a fifteenth and tenth was granted, possibly as late as 18 December, when parliament was still sitting.  The estreats sent to the collectors to aid their collection refer to the grant as having been made in 11 Henry VI, the regnal year in which parliament opened.  As in 1431, the lay residents of Lincoln were partly exempt from the tax: they were excused from half of the tenth which would have been levied there.For the first time, the grant included a provision for the remission of the sum of £4,000 from the c.£37,000 usually raised by a fifteenth and tenth, for the \'relief and discharge of the poor towns, cities and boroughs within the realm that are desolate, laid waste or destroyed, or over-greatly impoverished, or otherwise over-greatly charged\' for the tax.  This amounted to an open acknowledgment that the by-then fossilized assessments of the individual townships no longer accurately reflected the distribution of wealth throughout the realm.  The deducted sum of £4,000 was apportioned to each county, city and borough on a pro-rata basis, according to the overall assessment of each for the fifteenth and tenth, and a schedule of these reductions for this particular grant is now at E 179/242/72 (where it also gives the original sum due from an entire fifteenth and tenth as £38,170 23&#188;d). The knights of the shire of the parliament in which the tax was granted were appointed as commissioners to hold inquests to establish which towns were in need of a deduction from their share of the fifteenth or tenth.  They were then to inform the collectors by certificate how much of a share of the deduction each locality was to receive.  The collectors would adjust their collection from these towns accordingly, and would be allowed these deductions when rendering their accounts at the Exchequer.  Appointment of the commissioners for the re-distribution of the deduction usually took place shortly before the issue of letters patent to the collectors, for this reason, until 1468.  After that date, the two commissions were issued simultaneously.  The deduction for impoverished towns became, with few exceptions, a permanent feature of the fifteenth and tenth, from this point onward. The collection was to be made in four equal parts - on 28 March 1434; 11 November 1434; 17 April 1435; and 11 November 1435.  Commissions for the re-distribution of the £4,000 deduction were issued on 27 December 1433, and writs for collection of all four payments were issued on 1 February 1434.(|Rot.

153,1431 March 20 ,subsidy on lands ,Henry VI ,"Parliament opened on 12 January 1431, and on 20 March the commons granted a subsidy for the defence of the realm, similar to that levied in 1411 but at treble the rate.All tenants of knights\' fees, both men and women, lay and clerical, were to pay a tax of 20s. per knight\'s fee, the lowest threshold of tax liability being one-tenth of a knight\'s fee.  All freeholders of lands or rents, held by tenures other than knights\' fees, were to pay a tax of 20s. per £20 of the net annual value of that land, the lowest threshold of tax liability being £5 of net annual value of land.  At 5%, the rate of taxation was three times as great, and the taxable minimum was a quarter of that in 1411.Clerics were not to be charged for lands amortised since 20 Edward I, and there was a reduced rate of 10s. per knight\'s fee levied on the fifty knights\' fees in the county of Kent that were chargeable for the expenses of the knights of the shire elected to this parliament by that county.  No one who paid tax on knights\' fees was also to be charged for lands held by other tenures, and vice versa.Commissions for assessment of the tax were to be issued in Chancery to \'certain sufficient persons\' named by the king\'s council, who were to establish the liability of individuals to pay the tax by inquest of sworn jurors in the counties, cities and boroughs.  They were to enquire into the value and tenure of the lands, and to provide this information, together with the names of the tenants, their places of residence and their rank or profession.  No one elected to the parliament in which the grant was made was to be a commissioner or juror.  The inquisitions were to be returned into the Exchequer, whereupon estreats would be sent to the sheriffs of the counties, who were to collect the money and bring it to the Exchequer by 25 June 1431.  There was something of an appeals process for those who were \'grevez\' by any inquisition; they were to be \'admitted and received to traverse\' them, perhaps in the same manner as one who disputed the findings of an |inquisition post mortem| or other process initiated by a writ from Chancery.  Commissioners were appointed, and inquests were held and returned into the Exchequer; many of which have been printed in |Feudal Aids|.  The return of the inquests seems to have been delayed; in Worcestershire, Somerset and Dorset, for example, they were all held just after Martinmas (11 November) 1431, and in Hampshire they were not held until January 1432 (E 179/173/84).  The tax proved ultimately uncollectable, and after a petition presented by the commons in the next parliament complaining of various ambiguities, doubts, grievances, etc., involved in the levy of the tax, it was annulled and a half fifteenth and tenth was voted in its place.  The annulment was to be accompanied by the erasure of all traces of its levy from every court of record. (|Rot. Parl.|, IV, pp 356-357, 367-370, 409; |Feudal Aids|, V, pp 324-334; R.

On that day, the commons granted a fifteenth and tenth, less the remission of £4,000 for the relief of impoverished towns, as well as a tax on income.  The town of Andover in Hampshire was given complete exemption, and the city of Lincoln had to pay only half the tax.The commissions for re-distribution of the deduction in each county, city and borough were appointed on 1 January 1436, and writs for collection were issued on 3 January.  A file of certificates or lists of the names of collectors appointed to collect this tax is at E 179/241/368.  These make clear that the collectors were nominated by the knights of the shire and parliamentary burgesses.The tax was to be paid in four instalments: at Pentecost (27 May) and Martinmas (11 November) 1436 and on the same two feasts (19 May and 11 November) in 1437.(|Rot.

155,1435 Dec 23 ,"subsidy on lands, annuities and offices ",Henry VI ,"Parliament opened on 10 October 1435, and on 23 December 1435, in addition to a fifteenth and tenth, the commons granted a tax on income from freehold lands, rents, annuities, offices and other temporal possessions.The minimum threshold of liability to pay the tax was a net income of £5 per annum, after which a graduated rate was charged on all forms of taxable income.  On annual incomes from £5-100, the rate of taxation was 6d per pound.  On annual incomes from £101-399, the first £100 of this income was taxed at a rate of 6d per pound, but the second £300, that is, annual incomes of from £101 to £399, was taxed at a rate of 8d per pound.  Incomes of £400 or more were taxed at 2s. per pound on their entire income.  The income of the clergy was exempt, except for that received from property purchased or amortized since 20 Edward I.Commissioners named by the king\'s council were to be appointed in the various counties to make the assessments, summoning before them all persons whose incomes might prove to be taxable.  These commissioners, who were appointed by letters patent on 29 January 1436, were to certify the results into the Exchequer, providing the names also of those who did not appear before them; these defaulters would be summoned before the treasurer and barons to be examined.  The commissioners were not empowered to make enquiries about the income of the nobility, however; barons, baronesses and the higher nobility were to be examined before the chancellor and treasurer, and the order from the king\'s council for a warrant authorising the barons of the Exchequer to assess the nobility was not issued until 12 May 1436.  The divergent methods have produced two sets of assessments.  While names and assessments of non-baronial contributors were set down county by county, the names, incomes and assessments of lords and ladies, and others examined in Chancery, are listed separately.  All those persons who appeared before the treasurer and barons of the Exchequer - both members of the nobility, and persons who had declined to appear before the county commissioners and were subsequently summoned - were listed in schedules which were sewn into one roll (now E 179/240/269).  The list of defaulters is annotated with notes about their appearances.Assessments for sixteen counties, listing the names, incomes and tax due from each person, survive among the E 179 documents, except for the assessment for Northumberland, which, for some reason, was copied onto the enrolled account.  Two files of returns for individual members of the nobility (both lay and ecclesiastical), and other prominent individuals who were examined on their incomes before the chancellor and treasurer, exist among the King\'s Remembrancer\'s Miscellanea (E 163/7/31 parts 1 and 2).  They contain information not only on the landed estates of such persons, but some of these records of examinations also name the annuitants whose fees were allowable deductions from the total assessed income of their lords/ladies.  The returns for the nobility and others examined at Westminster were also entered on the enrolled account.The tax was payable in one instalment on 22 April 1436, and yielded between £8,500 to £9,000.  Selected entries from the returns for the counties are printed in the appendix of Gray, \'Incomes from Land in England\', and figures for the levels of income of individual members of the nobility are presented and analysed throughout.  The London return is printed in Appendix B of S.L. Thrupp, |The Merchant Class of Medieval London| (Chicago, 1948), pp 378-388.The subject of the income of the nobility based on the assessments for the income tax of 1435 is treated further in T.B. Pugh and C.D. Ross, \'The English Baronage and the Income Tax of 1436\', |BIHR|, XXVI (1953), 1-28.

The tariff of contributions was as follows:13s.4d. = all chaplains having chantries that are not assessed and not accustomed to pay a tenth with the clergy, nor a fifteenth with the laity, whose chantries are usually worth 10 marks annually.  If their chantries are worth more than 10 marks per annum, then they are to pay a whole tenth \'proportionally\', and all stipendiary priests and all collegiate and other chaplains earning an annual salary, stipend, pension or portion, in money or its equivalent, of 10 marks or more.6s.8d. = all chaplains having chantries that are not assessed and not accustomed to pay a tenth with the clergy, nor a fifteenth with the laity, whose chantries are usually worth less than 10 marks annually; and all stipendiary priests and all collegiate and other chaplains earning an annual salary, stipend, pension or portion, in money or its equivalent, of more than 100s. but less than 10 marks.Commissions for collection of the taxes were issued on 31 January 1436, and the names of the collectors were to be certified to the Exchequer by 24 February 1436.

After an appearance by the archbishop of York, who exhorted them \'with all possible diligence\' to grant a subsidy to the king, and much discussion in the days following, the clergy granted Henry VI a subsidy of half a tenth of ecclesiastical benefices, assessed according to the |Novo Taxatio|.  The tax was voted \'for the defence and salvation of the church and people of England, and especially of the marches towards Scotland, and in relief of the unwonted pressure of the charges and needs\' of the king, and was made on condition that the tax not be collected before the specified payment date.  A second moiety was apparently granted on condition that the clergy not be summoned or arrayed in person, or at their own expense, to defend the Scottish marches, by 1 November 1436.  The assembly was thus prorogued until 5 November 1436, when the clergy was to re-convene and make the grant, if the condition was met.Wholly excused from payment of the half a tenth were: (a) all priories, monasteries and benefices in Cumberland, Copeland (in Cumberland), Westmorland and Northumberland, and the temporalities and spiritualities annexed to them, and generally, all monasteries, benefices, places and possessions within the province that have been destroyed by fire or flood, to be certified by the relevant bishop or ordinary; (b) all monasteries of poor nuns and their goods, benefices and possessions, to be certified by the relevant bishop or ordinary; (c) all benefices with cure of souls, assessed by the |Nova Taxatio| or according to the old assessment (i.e., for the |Taxatio| of 1291), where the new assessment (or |Nova Taxatio|) has not been made, at 10 marks or less; (d) the lands and possessions of the abbey of Meaux (in Yorkshire), which have been destroyed by the waters of the sea and of rivers; (e) the monasteries of Watton and St. Michael\'s, Hull (in Yorkshire), and Shelford (in Nottinghamshire), with all their goods, benefices and possessions, in the province; and (f) the churches of Misterton (in Nottinghamshire), Topcliffe and Brodsworth (both in Yorkshire), which are appropriated to York Minster for the speedy completion of the repair of its fabric.Receiving exemption from one half of the levy, and paying thus only one quarter of a tenth, were: (a) the abbey of Selby, with all its goods, benefices and possessions, in the province; and (b) the prebend of Langtoft in York Minster.Commissions for collection were issued on 15 January 1437, and the names of the collectors were to be certified to the Exchequer on 2 February 1437, the same day upon which payment in full of the half a tenth was to be made.(|The Register of Thomas Langley, Bishop of Durham, 1406-1437|, ed.

191,1428 March 25 ,subsidy on parishes and knights\' fees ,Henry VI ,"Parliament began on 13 October 1427 and on the last day of parliament, 25 March 1428, the commons granted, for the defence of the realm, a tax of a new kind - a subsidy on parishes and knights\' fees.The tax on parishes was to be levied at three different rates, according to the value of the church and the location of the parish.  Each rural parish whose church was of an annual value of less than 10 marks, was to pay a tax of 6s. 8d., providing the parish contained at least ten resident householders, while those rural parishes whose churches were valued at 10 marks or more, were to pay 13s. 4d for every 10 marks of value (that is, a tenth).  The values of these rural churches were to be the values at which they were assessed towards the clerical taxes. Parishes within cities or boroughs of an annual value of 20s. or more were to be charged a rate of 2s. per 20s. of their churches\' values (again, a tenth).  In this case, the values of the parish churches were to be established by the holding of inquisitions.  In all three of these cases the tax was to be paid from the moveable goods of parishioners who were householders.The second part of the tax was on knights\' fees.  All tenants of lands freely held were to pay a tax of 6s.8d. per knight\'s fee, the lowest threshold of liability being a quarter of a knight\'s fee.The subsidy on parishes was to be paid at the next feast of Pentecost (23 May 1428), and that on knights\' fees at the Nativity of St John the Baptist (24 June 1428).  Letters patent for the collection of the tax were issued on 6 April 1428 (E 179/184/75).  Conditions attached to the grant were that no one elected to serve in the present parliament was to be made a commissioner, the collectors were to be given allowances for their labour and costs by the treasurer and barons of the Exchequer, and the duchess of Gloucester was to be exempt from payment of the tax.The tax yielded £12,291 but was never levied again (E 179/242/73).

The assembly sat until 21 December and twice members of the king\'s council asked for a grant of a subsidy.  On the final day of the session, and only with the greatest difficulty, the grant of three quarters of a tenth of assessed benefices was made, by a majority rather than a unanimous vote.The tax was granted on condition that: (a) neither the clergy nor their farmers be obliged to pay fifteenths with the laity on the goods and possessions for which they normally paid clerical tenths, but if any attempt was made to levy a lay tax on them, then they and their farmers would be excused payment of the three quarters of a tenth and in no way bound to pay it at all, and that they shall have a writ from the Exchequer to this effect as often as shall be necessary; (b) that if any collector appointed to levy the three quarters of a tenth certifies the Exchequer, on his oath, that he is unable to collect, or has been prevented from collecting, this tax from the alien priories or other ecclesiastical possessions, goods or benefices in the province, in whosoever hands they may be, even if in the king\'s hands, then that collector will be wholly discharged from making that collection and be quit at the Exchequer, and it will be left to the king and his ministers to collect it, and such collectors shall be no further vexed on that account; (c) that the king shall satisfy the collectors for the temporalities of cathedral churches and religious houses which are in his hands, or otherwise discharge the liability for them in the Exchequer without delay; (d) that no one appointed collector may be excused by obtaining any royal immunity or privilege from collecting the tax; (e) that no other payment or charge be laid upon the clergy during the period of collection of the tax, and if they are charged with any other grant or payment to the king, then they shall be quit and wholly discharged of the payment of the part or parts of the three quarters of a tenth still remaining to be paid, and in no way compelled to the payment of the outstanding amount, which will be wholly annulled; and (f) that the tax is not to be collected before the specified payment dates.Excused from payment were: (a) the goods, benefices and possessions of all poor religious (i.e. monks and canons), nuns (and canonesses), hospitals, and other pious places of the province, and the goods, possessions and benefices of all religious and other ecclesiastics within the province, whose monasteries, priories, places, goods, possessions or benefices have been destroyed, much impoverished or excessively diminished by floods, fires or other accidents;(b) poor benefices that, on account of their poverty, are unofficed;(c) unappropriated ecclesiastical benefices with cure of souls, assessed and accustomed to pay the tenth, the true value of which is 12 marks per annum or less, in which the rectors or vicars, or others by whatsoever name they be known, have resided and do reside continuously in person, or are absent from their benefice because they pursue the study of letters in one of the universities of the realm, having been sufficiently licensed to do so, upon which the relevant bishop is to certify the Exchequer, and such certificates are to be wholly accepted, so that neither the bishops, nor the collectors, nor the persons occupying the said benefices, are to be vexed by the king\'s writs, or in any other way, on this matter;(d) the ecclesiastical goods, possessions and benefices of the priory of Sheen (in Surrey), which has received a royal exemption from the payment of tenths or other clerical taxes; (e) ecclesiastical benefices of the diocese of Norwich which are vacant from the date of the grant to the date of the last payment of the subsidy, or any part thereof, and of which the bishop of Norwich is to receive the first fruits of that year, and of which the provents that remain after the deduction of those first fruits are 12 marks per annum or less, and in which the rectors and vicars of the same have resided, or, if absent, pursue the study of letters in one of the universities, having been sufficiently licensed to do so, to be certified by the bishop of Norwich or other ordinary;(f) the ecclesiastical goods, possessions and benefices of New College, Oxford, Winchester College (in Winchester), both foundations of [William of Wykeham], bishop of Winchester, and of the colleges of King\'s Hall (now Trinity College) and of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary (now Gonville and Caius College), both in Cambridge; and(g) the benefices, goods and possessions of all rectors, vicars and other beneficed clergy who, between the date of the grant and the date of the last payment of the tax, have been or shall have been indicted for rape or any other felony, on the certification of both the Exchequer and the collector of the tax, by the relevant bishop of the diocese, \'of the honest conversation and good report\' of the indicted clergy, especially regarding the matter upon which he/she has been indicted (|CFR 1430-1437|, p 228).

207,1432 Oct 3 or later ,one quarter of a clerical tenth from York province ,Henry VI ,"By a mandate of 2 September 1432, the archbishop of York summoned the clergy of the northern province to a provincial council at York on 3 October 1432.  The meeting was apparently prorogued on that date and continued on subsequent days, and before the session ended, the clergy granted the king a quarter of a tenth of all ecclesiastical benefices, both spiritualities and temporalities annexed to spiritualities.  The text of the grant notes that the archbishop took part in the discussions of the provincial council personally, and that he exhorted its members \'with all possible diligence\' to make a grant.  When they gave in to the pressure that he had exerted, they did so \'although they deem themselves unequal to supporting any such burden on account of their notorious poverty, which has been caused as well by excessive floods (which in the case of some churches of the province, both secular and regular, and especially of those whose rents, provents and possessions are near the sea, have wholly swallowed a notable part of the possessions and rents of the same), as by the choking of the corn and other fruits of the earth, and by the pestilence of beasts and herds\' (|CFR 1430-1437|, p 180).  The grant was made on condition that the tax not be collected before the specified payment date.Wholly excused from payment of the tax were: (a) the monasteries of Drax, Ellerton, Watton, Selby, Ferriby, St. Oswald, Nostell, Monkbretton, St. Michael\'s, Hull, Holy Trinity, York, Malton and Eggleston (in Yorkshire), and Mattersey, Felley, Rufford, Worksop, Shelford and Newstead (in Nottinghamshire); (b) all benefices of nuns [and canonesses], on account of their notorious poverty; (c) the community of the cathedral church of York (i.e. York Minster), and the churches of Misterton (in Nottinghamshire), Topcliffe and Brodsworth (both in Yorkshire), appropriated to York Minster for the speedy completion of the repair of its fabric; (d) the prebend of Langtoft in York Minster, and the church of Ferry Fryston (in Yorkshire), on account of their excessive assessment; (e) the lands and possessions of the abbey of Meaux (in Yorkshire), which have been destroyed by the waters of the sea and the Humber; (f) all priories, monasteries and benefices in Cumberland, Copeland (in Cumberland), Westmorland and Northumberland, and the temporalities and spiritualities annexed to them; and (g) all ecclesiastical benefices, dignities, prebends, hospitals, portions, pensions, temporalities and spiritualities, and temporalities annexed to spiritualities, which are assessed by the |Nova Taxatio| at 10 marks per annum or less.Receiving exemption from one half of the levy, and paying thus only an eighth of a tenth, were: (a) the lands and possessions of the monasteries of Whitby, Roche, Kirkstall, Pontefract, Bolton in Craven, Haltemprice and Rievaulx (in Yorkshire), Thornton-upon-Humber (in Lincolnshire), Thurgarton and Blyth (in Nottinghamshire) and Cockersand (in Lancashire); and (b) the church of Kirkham (in Lancashire), all of which are burdened by debt or almost destroyed by sea.Commissions for collection were issued on 13 November 1433, and the names of the collectors were to be certified to the Exchequer by 13 January 1434.

209,1440 Jan 14 x Feb 24 ,alien subsidy ,Henry VI ,"Xenophobic feeling was a constant feature of medieval life, but was at no time stronger in England than in the 1430s and 1440s, when the English suffered a series of reversals of fortune in France.  A host of anti-alien petitions had been presented in parliament in the 1430s, and the author of the 1436 treatise \'The Libelle of Englysche Polycye\' advocated the restriction of the liberties of aliens in the realm.  In the second session of the parliament which opened on 12 November 1439, measures were approved which attempted to control the trade of foreign merchants operating in England.  No aliens were henceforth to be allowed to buy or sell commodities to other aliens inside the realm and all were to be \'hosted\' by Englishmen who would help to enforce the restrictions placed upon them.  All alien merchants were also required to sell their goods within eight months of arrival in England and to buy goods available in England with their earnings within the same time limit.  The regulations were designed \'to prevent the suspected seepage of wealth from the realm\' and were to last for seven years.The widely-held opinion that aliens in England possessed greater wealth than did the king\'s subjects was behind another act passed within the sitting of the same prorogued parliament, which re-assembled at Reading on 14 January 1440, and was dissolved on 24 February 1440.  This act imposed the levy of a subsidy on all aliens, in the form of a poll tax, for three years.Two rates were to be levied: from alien householders an annual charge of 16d. per head was to be collected, and on aliens who were not householders, a yearly tax of 6d. per head would be charged.  Welshmen were exempt from the tax, as were some of those aliens who had purchased letters of denization, alien women who were married to English or Welsh men, those under the age of 12, and members of religious orders.  Attitudes towards the validity of exemptions varied, however, in different localities. Inquests were to be held before the justices of the peace in each county to ascertain the names of all aliens living within its bounds.  These inquests were to be returned into the Exchequer, after which commissions for collection would be issued to the sheriffs, or mayors or bailiffs (of cities, boroughs or liberties), as appropriate.  These officials were then responsible for collecting, delivering and accounting for the money at the Exchequer.  This form of administration of the levy of alien subsidies remained constant throughout the fifteenth century.The tax was payable in six equal instalments over the three years, at Easter and Michaelmas, commencing at Easter 1440.  Commissions to hold inquests for the first collection of the tax were accordingly issued on 28 February 1440; however, there was clearly a degree of delay in the administrative process for this collection.  Inquests were still being held in April, commissions for collection were being issued until at least early July (e.g. E 179/196/100 rot 1, sch 1, the commission to the sheriff of Wiltshire, dated 10 July 1440), and payment was requested by 25 June, almost exactly three months after Easter. The second payment appears to have run more smoothly.  Commissions to hold the inquests were issued on 3 June 1440, and payment was due by 30 September.  Theoretically, separate inquests were to be held for each of the first two payments, but documents from the city of York (E 179/217/46) clearly indicate that, rather than holding a second inquest, the second collection was administered using the information gathered during the original inquest, amended as necessary. Indeed, the heading for a list of aliens in Wiltshire (E 179/196/100 rot 1), which was produced at the Exchequer and sent to the sheriff with his commission, states that the individuals named were to pay the collections due at both Easter and Michaelmas 1440. For the remaining two years of this tax, it appears that inquests were held only once per annum, covering both payments, and commissions for the 1441 levy were not issued until 27 July 1441 (E 179/184/212, rot 2; E 179/120/83, m 1; E 179/235/10; E 179/141/68, rot 5).A large file of commissions and inquests held in various counties is at E 179/270/31.  The surviving returns have been analysed in full in S.L. Thrupp, \'A survey of the alien population of England in 1440\', |Speculum|, XXXII (1957), 262-273.  The returns for Southwark (in E 179/184/212), where a large number of aliens resided, are calendared in J.L. Bolton, |The Alien Communities of London in the Fifteenth Century: the Subsidy Rolls of 1440 and 1483-4| (Stamford, 1998). Some documents for this tax can also now be found amongst the sheriffs\' accounts in E 199; for instance, the particulars of account for the third and fourth payments in Essex and Hertfordshire are now at E 199/11/21, and an account for Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire for the first two payments are included in a composite account roll at E 199/4/30, which also includes other sums accounted by the sheriff, Henry Langley.By the third year of the subsidy, and indeed in all subsequent grants of alien subsidies, although Easter and Michaelmas technically remained the dates on which payment was due, the tax was collected only once per year.(|Rot.

The category of those aliens exempted from payment of the tax, however, was broadened to include the Irish (who had been charged in 1440-42) and the Channel Islanders.The subsidy was to last for two years, payable nominally at Easter and Michaelmas, and was to take effect at Easter 1443, after the conclusion of the levy of the subsidy granted in 1440 for three years.

Other towns, Cheltenham, Scarborough and Great Yarmouth among them, procured a partial exemption from the levy.The whole tax was to be paid by 11 November 1445, and letters patent to the commissioners for deductions and to the collectors were issued on 3 June 1445 (E 179/120/90).(|Rot.

The grant contained the unusual proviso that all assignments which had been granted upon the tax were annulled, thereby ensuring that the money raised would be used for the military purposes for which it was intended.  The inhabitants of Lincoln and Great Yarmouth were exempt.  On 4 April 1449, the greater part of the anticipated tax money (£6,667) was allocated to the defence of the seas, Calais and the Scottish border.The first half of the half was to be paid by 11 November 1449, and the second half by 11 November 1450.

219,1449 June 16 x July 16 ,alien subsidy ,Henry VI ,"A third session of parliament re-assembled on 16 June 1449 in Winchester and granted another alien subsidy for three years before the assembly was dissolved on 16 July.The annual rates to be levied remained the same as for the two previous alien subsidies levied.  Alien householders were to pay 16d. per head and alien non-householders were charged 6d. per head.  Two new categories of alien taxpayers were created, however.  Alien merchants (Venetians, Italians, Genoans, Florentines, Milaners, Luccans, Cateloners, Albertines - that is, members of the Florentine society of merchants known as the Alberti - Lombards, Hansers and Prussians, named on the parliament roll in that order) were required to pay 6s.8d. per head, and clerks of alien merchants were to be charged a tax of 20d. per head.  All merchants remaining in the country longer than six weeks were liable to pay.  A new category of exemption from the tax was also established; those aliens born under the king\'s allegiance in Normandy, Gascony and Guienne were exempt from the subsidy.The subsidy was payable annually on 29 September for four years - in 1449, 1450, 1451, and 1452 (this is the date mentioned in the grant; the writs give the payment date as 30 September).  Commissions for the assessment and levy of the first year were issued 20-28 July 1449, for the second year on 28 July 1450, for the third year on 14 July 1451 and for the final year on 20 July 1452 (E 179/235/31; however note E 179/173/119, the Hampshire commission for the final year: dated 12 July 1453, it replaced one which had not been received by the sheriff).(|Rot.

220,1450 June 5 ,"subsidy on lands, wages and fees ",Henry VI ,"Parliament opened on 6 November 1449 and lasted until 5 June 1450.  The session was dominated by political matters - namely, an attack on the duke of Suffolk and his courtiers, who had been in control of the government for several years.  It was not until the end of the session, therefore, that the commons granted a subsidy, which was, in effect, an income tax on landholders, wage earners and officeholders.There is evidence to suggest that the architects of this tax consulted the records of previous taxes in an attempt to find the most effective way of taxing the real sources of wealth within the realm; Roger Virgoe has postulated that an estimate summarising the yields of all taxes levied since the reign of Richard II, now E 179/242/73, which includes a figure (of £10,000) for the 1450 subsidy at the end, was compiled at this time.  The tax that was ultimately designed was modelled closely upon the subsidy of 1435, but with significant modifications to increase its yield.  It also broadened the basis of assessment geographically, as the tax was to be levied on lands held in the marches and Wales as well, and also in other places, such as Durham and Cheshire, normally exempt from Parliamentary taxation.  However, following a petition from a group of leading Cheshire men on behalf of the inhabitants of the county, the right to exemption was upheld, on the grounds that the county was not represented in Parliament.  In Wales, on the other hand, there is some evidence to suggest that the subsidy may have been extended to parts of the Duchy of Lancaster.  A subsidy or \'donum\' of 50 marks payable over the next three years on 25 March each year was grated at great sessions held at Kidwelly on 20 August 1451 by the Welshry, foreignry and town of Kidwelly (DL 29/584/9246 m. 1).  A similar subsidy of 50 marks was also granted by the whole commonalty of the commote of Carnwyllion, and one of 100s by the tenants and residents of the hamlet of St Ishmael, presumably on the same date.  The timing of this subsidy at least makes it likely that it was intended to coincide with the subsidy on lands under its revised terms.Whereas in 1435 only freehold lands were taxed, the subsidy of 1450 was also imposed upon copyhold lands and lands held by custom of the manor.  The taxation of fees and wages granted for a term of years was also a novelty, but probably, as in 1435, annuities paid to others by the taxpayer were allowable deductions from his/her taxable income.  More significant still, however, was the lowering of the thresholds of liability and the increase in the rates charged on the middle income brackets.Those holding lands of an annual value of 20s., had to pay 6d., while those at the next level up - tenants of lands worth between 20s. and £20 per annum - were to be charged a tax of 6d. per pound.  The rate doubled on lands worth between £20 and £200 per annum; these were taxed at 12d. per pound, and doubled again on landholders of over £200 worth of land per annum, to 2s. per pound.Those paid wages or fees for offices of an annual value of 40s., were to pay a tax of 12d.  The next band for wage earners and officeholders ran from 40s. to £20 per annum, on which the tax payable was 6d. per pound.  Those earning between £20 and £200 had to pay double this amount - 12d. per pound - and those with an annual income from wages or offices of £200 or more, were to be charged 2s. per pound.As in 1404, four treasurers - Sir William Lucy, Sir Thomas Tyrell, Sir James Strangways and Richard Waller, all experienced soldiers and administrators - were appointed to collect the subsidy.  They were to receive it from appointed collectors and pay it directly to the captains chosen by the king, and were to receive wages for performing this office, at the king\'s discretion.  Assessments were to be made by specially-appointed commissioners in each county, who were to examine under oath the residents of the county on their incomes.  The king\'s foundations of Eton College and King\'s College, Cambridge, were to be exempt from the tax, as were ecclesiastical lands; convocation voted a corresponding clerical subsidy in the following month.The disorders which followed the dissolution of parliament - Cade\'s Rebellion chief among them - meant that assessment and collection were impossible, and the commissions authorising them were delayed until 8 August 1450.  The sheriffs were now made responsible for collection, and they were to levy and collect the tax \'from time to time\'.  On the same day, the treasurers were instructed to receive loans in anticipation of the subsidy and pay the sums to the captains accordingly.  Although further unrest that year obstructed the collection of the subsidy, some loans were made to the treasurers in September 1450 (E 368/228, Hilary views of account, rot. 7).An extant copy of instructions sent to the sheriff of Newcastle, dated 20 September 1450, indicates that local constables were to provide him with the names of all persons dwelling in the city known to possess a taxable income.  These persons were to be summoned before them by warrant and were to make oaths as to the true value of their property, which was to include all escheats and wardships.  \'Temporal communitees\' (cities, towns, guilds and other corporations) were also to be examined, as well as clerics possessing property acquired since 20 Edward I (BL, Add MS 25,459, fos 300-303).A new parliament opened on 6 November 1450, and in December, the collection of the subsidy, which, it was noted, remained as yet unpaid, was given new parliamentary authorisation.  Writs were to be sent to the sheriffs ordering them to proclaim that the commissioners were to examine all persons liable to pay the tax.  Those failing to attend for assessment were to be charged with a triple subsidy.  Alterations made to the subsidy at this point indicate that there had been opposition to the tax from lower-income taxpayers:  the threshold of liability was raised from 20s. to 40s. in land, and from £2 to £3 per annum in fees and wages, thereby reducing the anticipated yield considerably.  The new act also made clear that individuals were to be assessed only in one county for all of their property.  The revised provisions were approved on 18 December, new writs were issued to the sheriffs on that date (see E 179/124/218, E 179/159/84 or E 179/196/118 for original letters patent attached to the sheriffs\' returns), and money from the subsidy began to be received during the summer of 1451.Returns which give details of the taxpayers survive for only a few counties - Cambridgeshire, Cornwall, Derbyshire, Herefordshire, Huntingdonshire, Kent, Nottinghamshire, Shropshire and Wiltshire, and the Kesteven division of Lincolnshire - and for three towns with county status - Norwich, York and Nottingham - all in the E 179 class of documents, with the exception of those for Shropshire (in E 101/681/39). Assessments for Lancashire, Staffordshire, Gloucestershire, Lincolnshire, Essex and Hertfordshire, and the city of Lincoln also exist in the E 179 class, but these do not include the names of the taxpayers.  There is also a composite roll giving summary accounts for Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, Essex and Hertfordshire, and Gloucestershire and Lincolnshire;  this same roll contains the full assessments of Norwich and Nottingham (E 179/238/78). The assessment for Newcastle upon Tyne has also been rediscovered amongst the E 179 records (E 179/158/54) where it was previously wrongly listed as an alien subsidy document, as were the particulars of account for Norfolk and Suffolk (E 179/235/27). The document relating to Newcastle upon Tyne is important as it includes a set of English instructions to the commissioners who were to levy the tax. Three assessments for Lancashire have also been discovered in PL 3/3 (mm 26, 28-9); however, two of these are damaged and incomplete, and it is unclear whether they cover the entire county.Payment was slow to come in, and by the end of 1453, only about three-quarters of the total assessment of just under £6,500 had been collected, which fell well short of the £10,000 which had been forecast.  Much of the work of the treasurers can be traced through the expense accounts that they submitted, which were enrolled on the King\'s Remembrancer\'s memoranda rolls (E 159), and in their state of account and claims for allowance enrolled on the Pipe Roll of 33 Henry VI (E 372/300, adhuc res Essex). Lists of those individuals who failed to appear for assessment and were thus charged at triple rates were also enrolled on the memoranda roll (E 159/228, Recorda, Michaelmas term, rot. 66).   The account of the four treasurers of their receipts of the subsidy from the collectors, and of their disbursements to military captains, for the period 1 June 1450 and 6 April 1455, which Dr. Virgoe believed to have been lost, is in E 364/89, m. 9.  The particulars of account of the treasurers for the years 1455 to 1459 is at E 179/240/316, and enrolled in PRO, E 364/94, m. 4.  For the subsidy monies collected before those dates, there is also an enrolled account of the collectors, on a roll that includes the accounts of the income taxes granted in 1404, 1411 and 1435.  That account does not include entries for Cheshire, Durham, Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmorland or the Cinque Ports.The returns and accounts have been analysed in Roger Virgoe\'s seminal article on the tax, where a table comparing the total amounts received in each county with the yields of the 1435 tax is printed (p. 138).  In the light of the recent discovery of the treasurers\' account for the years 1450-55, Dr. Virgoe\'s estimate of the total yield of the subsidy needs some adjustment.  The total received from the proceeds of the subsidy by the four treasurers between 1 June 1450 and September 1459 was almost £7,303, some £815 more than the yield which he calculated.(|Rot.

221,1453 March 28 ,fifteenth and tenth ,Henry VI ,"Parliament opened at Reading on 6 March 1453, and was subsequently adjourned on 22 April, to be re-convened at Westminster on 25 April.  Before the end of this first session, on 28 March, the commons granted a fifteenth and tenth, minus the deduction of £6,000 for impoverished towns, in addition to an alien subsidy and a subsidy to support 20,000 archers.  The inhabitants of both Lincoln and Great Yarmouth were exempt from the levy.  The first half was to be paid on 11 November 1453 and the second on 11 November 1454.For collection purposes, this grant and that of a half fifteenth and tenth, granted in a subsequent session of the same parliament, were treated as one tax grant; instructions to the collectors concerning exemptions, for example, cover both grants, even though the collection dates were different (see, for example, E 179/108/123; E 179/124/125), and letters patent authorising collection of both taxes were issued on 12 June 1453, after the appointment of commissions for distribution of the deductions four days earlier (E 179/189/93).(|Rot.

222,1453 March 28 ,alien subsidy ,Henry VI ,"Parliament opened on 6 March 1453 at Reading, and on 28 March, the commons granted an alien subsidy for the king\'s life, which was payable twice yearly at Easter and Michaelmas.  An alien poll tax inquest for Southwark, dated 10 October 1466, bears endorsements noting that it concerned the payments due at Easter and Michaelmas 1466 (E 179/184/110).  It seems that in some instances at least the procedure may have been to hold local inquests at the end of the tax year, if one may call it that, and levy the payments for that year retrospectively. The annual rates levied on most aliens remained the same as those levied in previous alien subsidies, at 16d. per head for alien householders and 6d. per head for alien non-householders.  Alien merchants, brokers, factors and their attorneys (named specifically as Venetians, Esterlyngs (eastern Hansards), Italians, Genoans, Florentines, Milaners, Luccans, Cateloners, Albertines, Lombards, Hansards, Prussians, in that order) were now to be charged more heavily, however, at 40s. per head for householders and 20s. per head for non-householders.Although the grant was made in 1453, orders to collect the tax were not issued until 11 or 12 November 1454, after the conclusion of the duke of York\'s first protectorate - the reluctance or inability of the duke to levy taxes in the king\'s name being no doubt the cause of the delay (|CPR 1452-61|, p 222, E 179/217/67 m 4).  When the letters patent were issued, they ordered collectors to levy six payments of the tax retrospectively (E 179/124/124).After the Yorkist seizure of power in 1461, Edward IV continued to levy the tax, citing this grant as his authority, and all tax documents reciting that authority were careful to state that the grant was for the \'natural\' life of Henry VI which, by implication, bore no relation to whether or not he was still the ruling monarch.  Edward\'s first levy was not until 1463; the letters patent ordering collection and appointing collectors were issued on 8 March 1463, but the collection was to be made retrospectively of those payments due in the first two years of Edward\'s reign (see, for example, E 179/141/88, and E 179/124/123, where authority for the levy was said to derive from the grant made \'in the last parliament held at Reading\').  Edward IV continued to levy the tax under the authority of this grant, even after the re-adeption of Henry VI had failed and Edward regained the throne on 11 April 1471.  The account of Henry Pierrepont, sheriff of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire for the collection due at Easter 1471, survives, along with inquests held (retrospectively) in September of that year (E 179/236/129).  As the account explains, at Henry VI\'s death on 22 May 1471, the grant expired and authority to levy the tax ceased.In addition to the many inquests, assessments and accounts relating to the levy of this tax which were returned to the Exchequer and are among the E 179 documents, records of the levy of alien subsidies in Somerset and Dorset from 1455 to 1462 survive in the Dorset Record Office, Dorchester (ref: D/WLC/X2).

223,1453 July 2 ,half a fifteenth and tenth ,Henry VI ,"Parliament opened at Reading on 6 March 1453, and on 2 July 1453, the last day of its second session, the commons granted a half fifteenth and tenth, in addition to the whole fifteenth and tenth granted in the first session of the same parliament, subject to the usual deduction, pro-rated (£3,000).  The money raised by the levy was intended to finance the war in Gascony and the grant was made in return for the reduction in the number of archers (from 20,000 to 13,000), which were to be supported by the subsidy granted in the first session of this parliament.  The first half of the half was to be paid on 2 February 1454 and the second on 24 June 1454.  Neither the city of Lincoln nor the town of Great Yarmouth was to be charged.This tax and the fifteenth and tenth granted earlier in the same parliament were administered together, as is indicated in instructions to the collectors concerning exemptions (E 179/108/123).  In fact, commissions to collect both taxes were issued on 12 June 1453, four days after the appointment of commissioners to distribute the deduction for impoverished towns from both taxes, and the accounts of the collectors of both taxes were enrolled together.  The appointments of commissioners and collectors were evidently made in anticipation of the grant of the half fifteenth and tenth on 2 July.  On the other hand, exemption certificates for Cinque Port barons show that in some places the two payments of this half fifteenth and tenth were levied separately from the whole fifteenth and tenth granted on 28 March (see E 179/234/3, mm. 3-4).(|Rot.

Various towns, including the city of Lincoln, were wholly excused from payment.Payment was spread over four collections, as follows: the first quarter of the whole fifteenth and tenth on 24 June 1440;the second and third quarters of the whole fifteenth and tenth on 11 November 1440;the fourth quarter of the whole fifteenth and tenth at Easter (16 April) 1441;the half fifteenth and tenth on 11 November 1441.Letters patent were issued to commissioners for the distribution of the sums deducted for impoverished towns on 20 April 1440, and to the collectors of all four payments of the tax on 24 April 1440 (E 179/124/106; E 179/120/85).(|Rot.Parl|., V, pp 3-6; J.C.

583,1453 March 28 ,"subsidy to raise and maintain 13,000 archers ",Henry VI ,"Parliament opened on 6 March 1453 at Reading, and the situation in France called for emergency measures.  On 28 March, before its adjournment on 22 April, when it was prorogued until 25 April at Westminster, the commons granted a subsidy to the king in the form of a grant of 20,000 archers, to be raised proportionally in the counties, according to their \'substance\', and maintained for six months.  The commons were to levy these troops in whatever way they devised, provided that they gave four months\' notice to the mustering forces to assemble.  The grant was made on the understanding that it was not to serve as a precedent for future grants.In the new session which began on 25 April, the king discharged the commons of their obligation to provide 7,000 of the archers granted, and agreed to a force of 13,000 archers, to be supported, as initially conceded, for six months.  Each county and town was allocated a share of the 13,000 archers, which they were to finance over that period - the proportions being set down in the grant.  The counties were to provide the lion\'s share of archers (about 10,900) and the towns would furnish the remaining 2,100.  R.S. Schofield has shown that the allocation of the archers to the counties was made according to the ratio of one archer for every 50 marks assessed on the counties in the levy of the 1334 fifteenth and tenth, net of the sums allowed for the expenses of the collection, and after modification to take into account the allocation of archers to the towns.  These apportionments did not accurately reflect, therefore, the actual distribution of wealth among the counties.Commissioners were to be appointed for each county and town to determine \'aswell by enquerre as examination\' how many archers there were, and \'of the londes, tenementes, rents and possessions\' within their remit, and who their owners and possessors were.  One year\'s income from these lands, to include goods and chattels, was to be assessed and charged by these commissioners for the maintenance of the archers raised there.  The commissioners were to deliver written indentures to the local officials (bailiffs of hundreds, mayors or constables of towns, or local lords) stating how many archers were to be charged to their localities.  The second part of the indentures were to be sent into the Exchequer, certifying that the archers had been secured to appear on a day and place to be determined by the king.  Proclamations were to be made in three or four places within the counties giving notice to the archers to assemble in four months\' time.  They were to indent to serve with the captains appointed by the king to lead them.Exempt from this tax were to be the king\'s two foundations of Eton College and King\'s College, Cambridge, the possessions of Queen Margaret, and the nobility as a whole, or anyone enfeoffed to their use, as well as the spiritualities (or titheable estates) of the clergy.A further concession exacted by the commons was that the levy would be postponed for two years from Easter, unless the king himself was to lead the army to France, and in the event, the grant was never put into execution.The grant of this tax is significant, however, in demonstrating that ways of taxing sources of wealth more effectively were being sought, and may have been the product of a discussion held by the lords in the summer of 1449, when the levying of a year\'s income upon every landowner or annuitant was proposed by the bishop of Coventry and Lichfield.  The grant also served as a precedent for a similar grant of 13,000 archers made to Edward IV in 1472.  A promise not to levy the 1453 grant was one of the conditions imposed by the commons in return for their assent to the grant of 1472 - perhaps an indication that the re-activation of the earlier grant had been under consideration.(|Rot.

591,1430 March 6 ,forced loan ,Henry VI ,"In order to aid further the planned French expedition by Henry VI, commissioners to raise loans were appointed by letters patent on 6 March 1430, on the advice of the king\'s council.  They were instructed to convoke the clergy, knights, esquires and other notable persons in the counties, and the bailiffs and substantial townsmen in the cities and boroughs, \'to move and persuade them to lend to the king a notable sum of money for the voyage\' proposed to take place in April, in order \'to make a speedy end of his wars there\'.  Repayment was to be secured on the second payment of the second fifteenth and tenth granted in the last parliament (on 20 December 1429), and was to take place by 1 July 1430.Nil returns made by the commissioners in Gloucestershire, dated in April and May 1430, and a return promising only paltry sums from Devon are in E 34/1B.  Some large loans were also procured, however, and by mid-May, some £24,000 had been negotiated by commissioners.  Most notably, the city of London lent 10,000 marks, the feoffees of the duchy of Lancaster provided £3,029, and almost £10,000 was borrowed from Cardinal Beaufort.  The staplers of Calais lent £2,333 in July, not secured by the projected receipts of the fifteenth and tenth, but by five of the king\'s councillors, and later by a clerical tenth. The assignment on the fifteenth and tenth proved inadequate to repay the creditors; the duchy of Lancaster feoffees were given an assignment on the customs at Southampton, but their loan had still not been entirely repaid by May 1436.(|CPR 1429-36|, pp 49-51, 104, 111; Griffiths, |Henry VI|, pp 119, 126, cf.

Commissioners were to negotiate with the knights, esquires, gentlemen, townsmen and clergy and induce them to lend money for the voyage to France, undertaken \'for the defence of his realm of England\'.  Security for the loans made was to be provided by the one and a third fifteenths and tenths granted in the last parliament, as well as by the \'customs, subsidies and other profits and revenues of the king\'.  The commissioners were asked to certify their results to the Exchequer as soon as possible.In Norfolk and Suffolk, the earl of Suffolk persuaded the wealthier members of the population to lend £1,500; the city of Norwich was especially forthcoming.  London lent another 5,000 marks.The receipts of this and other loans, amounting to £33,322, were delivered to the king\'s wardrobe in France between Michaelmas 1429 and May 1431.(|CPR 1429-1436|, pp 124-127; Griffiths, |Henry VI|, pp 119-120, 126, cf.

The commissioners were enjoined to \'treat with important persons in the county for a considerable loan to the king\'.  Security for repayment was to be given on the \'customs, subsidies, revenues, jewels and movables of the crown\', as well as the grants of taxation made to the king in the last parliament.  The results of these negotiations were to be reported to the treasurer as soon as possible.Little money from this loan was received into the Exchequer in 1434, suggesting that there was some resistance to its imposition.  On 15 May 1435, however, a series of loans were contracted, with their repayment ordered on 9 July 1435 from the receipts of the customs and the final payment of the fifteenth and tenth granted in 1432.  A schedule of lenders and amounts contributed is included in the letter patent for repayment.  As before, the largest lenders were Cardinal Beaufort (£7,167), the feoffees of the duchy of Lancaster (£3,091) and the city of London (£2,667).(|CPR 1429-1436|, pp 353-355; Steel, |Receipt of the Exchequer|, pp 205-206; |CPR 1429-1436|, pp 466-467; Griffiths, |Henry VI|, pp 120, 126) ",Origin  Imposed,1st: 1434 Feb 26

The letter sent to magnates, clerics, substantial knights and esquires, cities, towns and merchants asking for specific sums, all of whom are listed, was copied into the record of the proceedings of the king\'s council.  The money was to be delivered to the treasurer by 1 April.The loans were to be secured by the fifteenth and tenth granted in the last Parliament.  The appeal was successful; loan receipts at the Exchequer in Michaelmas term 1435-6 reached one of the highest figures in the century.  London lent 5,000 marks, the duchy of Lancaster feoffees gave £2,180 and the staplers of Calais provided £5,393, but the largest lender by far was Cardinal Beaufort, who paid over £28,000 into the Exchequer between February and August 1436.Although Cheshire was generally exempt from taxation on the grounds that it was not represented in Parliament, it seems that on this occasion, coinciding with the non-Parliamentary levy on the rest of England, the county also made a contribution towards the war with France.  On 3 March 1436, the sheriff was ordered by the king to summon a group of thirty men to appear before the king\'s council in the Exchequer of Chester.  After consultations of members of that group in each hundred of the county, the sheriff and a smaller body of representatives met with the council again and granted the king a mise of 1000 marks.  From evidence in the receipt roll, it may be that the county palatine of Durham also granted a contribution at this time, showing the crown\'s desire to widen the scope of revenue raising, in time of need, to areas not normally included in taxation.(|POPC|, IV, pp 316-29; Steel, |Receipt of the Exchequer|, pp 208-209; Griffiths, |Henry VI|, pp 120-121, 126-127); D J Clayton, |The Administration of the County Palatine of Chester 1442-1485| (Manchester, 1990), pp 49 note 16, 53-4.

On 19 March 1439, commissioners were appointed in all counties to \'treat with one another and with other persons\' in their respective counties for \'a notable loan\' to the king \'in his present necessity\'.  They were authorised to promise lenders the necessary security from the customs, subsidies and other royal revenue, and \'out of the jewels and other moveables of the king and his crown\'.  The money raised by these loans was to be conveyed with all speed to the Exchequer receipt.Nil returns received from the commissioners appointed in Staffordshire and Herefordshire, and a poor return (naming just two lenders) from the Gloucestershire commissioners, are now among the Exchequer miscellanea at E 163/7/19-21.  Another nil return to a commission dated 20 March 1439, made by commissioners in Rutland, is in C 47/7/6.According to Anthony Steel, loans totalling £14,000 were received in Michaelmas term 1439-40, as recorded on the receipt roll.  Of this amount, £6,666 13s.4d. was contributed by Cardinal Beaufort.(|CPR 1436-1441|, pp 249-250; Griffiths, |Henry VI|, pp 376-377; Steel, |Receipt of the Exchequer|, pp 214-215) ",Origin  Imposed,1st: 1439 March 19
596,1442 March 30 - 1443 May 15 ,forced loan ,Henry VI ,"In 1442, three commissions - on 30 March, 8 May and 28 August - were appointed to treat with lay and ecclesiastical persons in their respective counties for a loan to the king for the purpose of raising an army.  Although its appointment was not enrolled in Chancery, at least one further commission was issued in the following year - on 15 May.  The money was again secured by the taxation recently granted in parliament and by convocation.A nil return made to the first commission (that of 30 March) appointed in Dorset, and four nil returns made by commissioners in four counties appointed under the second commission (that of 8 May) survive among miscellaneous classes of documents in the PRO.  One of these, the nil return made on 28 May 1442 by the Staffordshire commissioners of the second commission, is in the Exchequer miscellanea at E 163/7/24.  The others - for the East Riding of Yorkshire, Herefordshire and Dorset, together with the return of the first commission in the latter county - are among the Chancery miscellanea in C 47/7/6, where another nil return for Herefordshire to the third commission (that of 28 August) also survives.  All but the Staffordshire return are accompanied by the original commissions.An original commission sent to the commissioners appointed to the third commission in Lincolnshire is also extant, as well as a detailed return made by the commissioners for part of the county.  The commissioners sat at Glanford Brigg, Louth and Caistor on 19 September.  Their return listed those who contributed and the amounts given, those charged to appear before the king\'s council in London to make their excuses on 30 September, those who were ill and those who did not appear before them.  Persons excused from lending appear at the beginning of the document, together with a detailed report of their reasons for not doing so.  The abbot of Newsome, for example, claimed to be afflicted with \'greet myscheff of the stepyll and of the closter\', as well as a \'greet mortalite of the shepe\'.  Another abbot was in debt because \'he has so greet charge of ospytalite contynually\'.  One Roger Keell was unable to lend because the forest around his dwelling house had burnt down (E 34/1B).  An original commission to the same Lincolnshire commissioners issued on 15 May 1443, endorsed with their return, survives in BL, Cotton MS Cleo. F.VI (on fo 235).  The endorsed return attests that they delivered the blank privy seals to 11 named persons - the abbot of Newsome (who had been excused in the previous year), a few canons of Lincoln cathedral, and the rest esquires and other laymen - but none of these were willing to lend.  The return also names six persons who declined to appear before them. Despite these difficulties, more than £17,600 was received, excluding the contributions made by Cardinal Beaufort and the staplers of Calais.(|CPR 1441-1446|, pp 61, 68, 92; Griffiths, |Henry VI|, pp 391, 399) ",Origin  Imposed,1st: 1442 March 30 - 1443 May 15
598,1446 June 1 ,forced loan ,Henry VI ,"On 1 June 1446 commissioners to raise loans were appointed in order to finance a planned journey to France in October, when the king was to \'confer with his uncle of France (Charles VII) for a final peace\'.  The commissioners were to treat with diverse persons of the counties for a loan and bring the proceeds to the Exchequer receipt before the octave of Midsummer (1 July) if possible, and in any case, before the quinzaine of Midsummer (8 July).  They were given further authority to promise repayment from the \'customs, subsidies and other royal revenues, and from the jewels and goods of the crown\'.There was some resistance to the imposition of this loan, perhaps because no military campaign was to be funded from the money.  No more than four of those who met with commissioners in the Chapter House at York were willing to make loans, and in Hampshire also only four persons contributed, even though fifteen of the twenty potential lenders had appeared before the commissioners when summoned, as the surviving report of the meeting of the Hampshire commissioners at Winchester attests (E 34/1B).  Nil returns made by commissioners appointed on 1 June in Warwickshire, Leicestershire, Herefordshire, Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, Huntingdonshire and Cambridgeshire, and Lincolnshire, together with the original commissions, are now among the Chancery miscellanea (C 47/7/6).That the loan-raising effort was not yielding the desired sums by the prescribed dates is indicated by surviving instructions to the commissioners appointed in Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex and Hertfordshire, dated 20 July 1446.  Without the threat of compulsive military service, the tone that the commissioners were to adopt was persuasive rather than coercive.  They were to ask clergymen either to advance the first half of the clerical tenth which had recently been granted in convocation or to lend upon the strength of it, and to laymen, they were instructed to give surety for repayment from the taxes granted at the last parliament, the taxes payable at Martinmas 1446 excepted.  The commissioners were to be furnished with privy seal letters for the lenders, with the names left blank and to be filled in by them, and thereafter delivered to the intended recipients.  The money was to be paid into the Exchequer by 30 September at the latest.  The commissioners and lenders were to draw up indentures specifying the sum to be paid and the date of payment.  An original commission issued on 20 July 1446 to the commissioners for Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, giving these instructions, endorsed with their nil return is in C 47/7/6(19).Nevertheless, the yields after the issue of these instructions, at least in Yorkshire, seem to have been more fruitful.  Various indentures between the commissioners and lenders survive in E 34/1B, all drawn up in September 1446 and promising payment on 30 September or 12 October.  At least one of these lenders added a condition to the indenture specifying from which source the assignment of revenue for repayment had to be made; this was the tax collected in the town of Scarborough. Approximately £2,750 was raised in loans between July and December 1446, including at least £1,333 from the city of London.

Lenders were to be given security for repayment from the grants of taxation made in the last parliament and by convocation of the province of Canterbury.Several indentures between the commissioners and lenders survive for the Somerset commission headed by Thomas bishop of Bath and Wells.  On 23 October the abbot of Keynsham agreed to deliver to the Exchequer 20 marks by 12 November, provided that he receive a \'sufficiant assignement\' on that date for repayment, which was agreeable to him.  One of the \'commons of Axbridge\', John Neuton esquire, indented for £10, provided that \'he go nat over with my lord of Suffolk or another chieftain in the king\'s service\' (E 34/1B).  Promises of at least £12,250 in loans were elicited, including £2,000 from the city of London.  The executors of Cardinal Beaufort pledged £2,040 worth of the king\'s jewels which had been pawned to the prelate. (|CPR 1446-1452|, pp 297-299; Griffiths, |Henry VI|, pp 391, 399, cf.

602,c. 1453 Jan 9 ,forced loan ,Henry VI ,"In order to provide relief for the army in Gascony, under the command of John Talbot, earl of Shrewsbury, commissioners were appointed in early January 1453 to treat with lay and ecclesiastical persons, and \'the commons\' for a loan, which was to be received at the Exchequer receipt by 24 January.  Another commission, appointed on 18 January for the same purpose in Lincolnshire, was requested to have the money at the Exchequer fifteen days later (on 3 February), and it is likely, therefore, that the commissions appointed in all the other counties allowed a similar length of time for payment, and were issued c. 9 January.Several \'form\' letters issued under the privy seal, filled in with the names of lenders and the amounts promised, were returned into the Exchequer and are now at E 34/1B.  Promises of loans were easier to come by, however, than actual payment of them, as a letter of July 1453 copied in the proceedings of the king\'s council makes clear.Nonetheless, the request for a loan met with the most generous response yet, as more than £22,450 was paid in.  Only £333 of this sum was provided by the city of London, however, and the king\'s other large creditors notably refrained from lending, perhaps because parliamentary guarantees of security for lenders ceased after 1449.  On 8 June 1453, collectors of the fifteenth and tenth granted on 28 March 1453 were directed to repay all lenders under this commission from their receipts, upon the instructions of either the loan commissioners or the knights of the shire of the last parliament.

604,c. 1444 July ,forced loan ,Henry VI ,"Negotiations for the marriage of Henry VI and Margaret of Anjou were brought to a successful conclusion in June 1444, when a truce was also proclaimed, and preparations for the new queen\'s reception in England began to be made in August 1444.  The truce was announced by Henry VI on 27 June, and the king\'s ambassadors returned to England in late July.  It was probably in early or mid July, therefore, that commissioners were appointed to raise loans in the counties to help meet the expenses of the king\'s marriage.Instructions to these commissioners, emphasizing the truce concluded by the earl of Suffolk and Adam Moleyns that brought hopes of a permanent peace, and the expenses to which the king had been put by the long war, which had \'bared him of tresour and redy good[s]\', were copied into the proceedings of the king\'s council.  The commissioners were to treat with both lay and clerical persons for loans \'under sufficient assignment\' of whatever sums they could be persuaded to part with.  They were to indent with lenders, who were to agree to provide specific sums by certain dates, the bills of indenture to be returned into the Exchequer receipt by 10 August, or 15 August, at the latest, 1444.Four letters patent issued to lenders for repayment (to the abbot of Cirencester, the prior of Lanton, Sir John Fastolf and Sir John Popham), dated 19-24 August and 9 October 1444, are in E 34/1B.  All were given assignments on the customs of London, Bristol or Southampton.About £6,200 was received between August 1444 and February 1445, £1,333 of which was lent by the city of London.(J.

605,1455 May 14 ,forced loan ,Henry VI ,"On 14 May 1455 letters of instruction were sent in the king\'s name to commissioners who had been appointed to raise loans for the defence of Calais.  The enrolment of letters patent appointing these commissions does not seem to have occurred, but the commissioners were more than likely appointed on the same date as the letters of instruction, which were copied into the proceedings of the king\'s council.  A list of the commissioners in each county, to whom the instructions and letters of privy seal were to be sent, follows the instructions.  An original letter of instruction to the commissioners appointed in Essex survives in BL, Harl MS 309, fo 45, where it is wrongly attributed to 33 Henry VIII.The commissioners were to \'entreat cities, towns, abbeys, priories and worshipful men\' to lend sums of money in order to raise a \'notable number of men of war\' for the defence of Calais, which was on the point of being besieged by the French.  They were to inform them of the situation in Calais and tell them that many lords and other notable persons had already promised \'by way of loan notable sums of money\'.  The money that was to be raised by this loan would be put into a locked chest, with the keys in the hands of \'notable persons\', and would not be touched unless necessary.  Repayment would be secured by \'the next grant made to [the king] in parliament or convocation\', and everyone who lent money would be given a letter patent under the king\'s great seal for repayment, free of charge.  All sums promised were to be delivered to the city of London where they would be conveyed to the king\'s receivers.  The king and council were to be notified in writing of what sums were to be lent and by whom, and the commissioners were to indent with the lenders for the money.  Privy seal letters \'with blank tails\' (that is, form letters with blank spaces for the names of the lenders and the amounts which they agreed to lend) were also to be sent to those persons identified by the commissioners as potential contributors.The execution of these commissions probably never occurred; at the battle of St. Albans, fought on 22 May 1455, the duke of Somerset, thought to have been the driving force behind this appeal for a loan, was killed, and the position of the duke of York as protector was \'too delicate for him to risk pursuing Somerset\'s appeal to the king\'s more prosperous subjects\'.  A loan was negotiated with the staplers of Calais instead.(|POPC|, VI, pp 234-244; Griffiths, |Henry VI|, pp 754-755, 770; Harriss, \'Aids, Loans and Benevolences\', p 4) ",Origin  Imposed,1st: 1455 May 14
608,1426 July 23 ,forced loan ,Henry VI ,"On 23 July 1426 commissioners were appointed in all counties (except Derbyshire) to raise loans for the costs of the king\'s military campaign in France. The commissions were made up of knights and prominent clerics, and the intention was clearly to solicit loans from both laity and clergy. Original commissions survive from Cheshire and Lancashire, Essex, Leicestershire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire, and Northamptonshire, and the diocese of Hereford.According to the commissions, they were to treat with \'the better sort of\' secular persons in their respective counties and persuade them \'by the best ways and means that they could\' to lend money to the king until the quinzaine of the feast of John the Baptist next (8 July 1427). On that date, lenders would be repaid out of the tunnage and poundage granted to the king in the parliament which had met in February at Leicester. The loans were to be paid into the Exchequer by 1 September 1426.The returns to this commission are spread among three different series of documents (E 28, E 34 and E 179). It is clear from a large bundle of them, comprising in all 22 documents, that the lay and clerical commissioners for the most part operated independently, with the latter often charged only with treating with the wealthier religious and secular clergy of their dioceses and usually making separate returns regarding them (179/67/33B). Generally speaking, the clerical commissioners seem to have met with a better response than their lay counterparts.The bishop of Bath and Wells, a commissioner in Somerset, returned a list of 11 lenders, ten of whom were heads of monastic houses, with the abbot of Glastonbury, who lent 100 marks, topping the table (E 179/67/33B, m. 1). The bishop of London similarly met with a reasonable response, primarily, but not exclusively, from monastic clergy in all four archdeaconries of the diocese (E 179/67/33B, mm. 11-12). The same is true for the bishop of Worcester (E 179/67/33B, mm. 20-21; copy in Worcs. R.O., Register of Thomas Polton, Bishop of Worcester, ff. 5v-6r, with one additional donor, the rector of Breedon). Thomas Spofford, bishop of Hereford, was unable to sign up any of his clergy, but he himself promised to lend 80 marks (E 179/67/33B, mm. 9-10).Elsewhere the clergy were less generous. The bishop of Coventry and Lichfield returned that none would lend, citing hardship caused by the late payment of the last half a tenth paid there (due to have been collected on 11 November 1425) (E 179/67/33B, m. 6). Similarly, the clergy of the diocese of St. Asaph pleaded great penury (E 179/67/33B, m. 17). In the diocese of Chichester none of the clergy were prepared to lend, but the vicar-general of spiritualities, Simon Northew, a cathedral canon, acting on behalf of Bishop John Rickinghall, who was reportedly too busy to be involved, managed to persuade the wealthiest to pay (on 18 October 1426) an anticipation of the half a clerical tenth due to be paid on 2 February 1427 (E 179/67/33B, mm. 2-5).The commissioners in Middlesex returned a list of 20 laymen, plus the dean of St. Paul\'s Cathedral, who were prepared to lend small sums, the largest being the £20 each lent by the dean and by Henry Somer, an Exchequer official (E 179/67/33B, mm. 13-14). In Surrey, similarly, thirteen individuals lent small amounts and the men of Kingston upon Thames gave £20. In Rutland, the two commissioners returned that the various lay men with whom they had treated would lend a total sum of £50, but gave no further details (E 179/67/33B, m. 16).However, the commissioners in Staffordshire - the bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, Humphrey, earl of Stafford, Edmund, Lord Ferrers of Chartley and Walter Bullok, clerk - returned that they could not personally lend because they were indebted to others for great sums of money, nor could they persuade anyone else in the county to do so (E 179/67/33B, m. 7). The Cumberland commissioners likewise made a nil return, listing a number of excuses - debts, expensive marriages and border conflict (E 179/67/33B, m. 22). There were discouraging returns also from Essex, Leicestershire, Norfolk, Suffolk, Dorset and Hertfordshire (E 28/47/36, mm 14-17, 20, 43).Nil returns from Northamptonshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire provoked second letters from the king under his privy seal on 4 September 1426 (E 34/1B, mm. 137-143). He berated them for their poor results, asking them to redouble their efforts and send the names of persons willing to lend and the amounts that they could supply, as well as the names of all those whom they had interviewed, and their responses, by 30 September. In order to aid their efforts, he provided them with form letters under his privy seal for both the commonalties of the towns and for individuals within the county, leaving blank spaces to write in the names of towns/persons whom they thought would be likely candidates to make such loans. The commissioners were to write the names of the addressees on the dorse of these privy seal letters and have them delivered. A similar letter, recited in their returns, was apparently also sent on 4 September to the commissioners in Devon and Cornwall, and Kent (E 179/67/33B, mm. 8, 15). In the latter, the letter was sent to a different set of commissioners from the first, and was headed by the bishop of Rochester.Although the commissioners in Northamptonshire and Oxfordshire and Berkshire made nil returns to this second letter, they complied in both cases with the request to list the persons who had appeared before them. The Northamptonshire commissioners returned a list of 28 names, the great majority of them designated \'esquire\', but also William Penythorn, merchant, and Hugh Martyn, \'grasier\'. The other commissioners named 22 persons interviewed by them, 11 each in Oxfordshire and Berkshire. Only two were knights; the rest were esquires or substantial townsmen of Oxford, Burford or Abingdon (E 34/1B/137-143). In Devon, the commissioners gave a host of reasons why no one there would lend, which included \'unprofitable and unfortunate marriages of their sons and daughters\', disruption to commerce from the poor keeping of sea ports and the high costs of building works. In Cornwall merchandise ready for export was said to be standing stagnant because of wars and the clergy was destitute. The commissioners also sent a list of those whom they had interviewed, which included a peer (Lord Bonville), four knights, nine esquires, the dean and chapter of Exeter, and leading townsmen in Dartmouth, Plymouth and Barnstaple (E 179/67/33, m. 8). The commissioners in Kent made a nil return and also declined to send any names (E 179/67/33B, m. 15).Although only the returns noted above have been traced, it is evident that the loan was a \'conspicuous failure\'. In the diocese of Worcester, for example, only £295 was in fact collected from fourteen religious houses.(|CPR 1422-1429|, pp 353-356; |Rot. Parl|., IV, p 302; H.

798,1429 Dec 20 ,"graduated poll tax on unbeneficed clergy, Canterbury provinc ",Henry VI ,"A convocation of the southern clergy initially assembled at St. Paul\'s, London, on 5 July 1428, in order to discuss various matters.  It was prorogued twice, and its third and final session began on 19 October 1429.  The main issues under consideration in this session were illegal purveyance by the king\'s household and the unjust indictment of clerks on charges of felony.  On 25 October, a delegation arrived from the king\'s council, namely, Thomas Kemp, archbishop of York and chancellor, the duke of Norfolk, the earls of Warwick, Stafford and Salisbury, and Ralph, Lord Cromwell, and Robert, Lord Hungerford, to plead with the clergy to vote the king a large subsidy.  After prolonged debate, the clergy submitted to the pressure applied by these lords on 20 December 1429, when they granted two subsidies: one and a half tenths on assessed benefices, and a graduated poll tax on the unbeneficed clergy.The tariff of rates for the poll tax were as follows:6s.8d. =  all priests, celebrants of anniversaries, and stipendiaries in receipt of an annual salary of 100s. (or its equivalent);13s.4d. =  all parochial chaplains and other stipendiaries, not members of a college, in receipt of an annual salary of 9 marks or more, but less than 12 marks, in money or its equivalent, and all chantry priests whose chantries are not assessed or accustomed to pay a tenth (or lay) fifteenth, and which are worth 10 marks or more, but less than £10, per annum;20s. =  all parochial priests and other stipendiaries in receipt of an annual salary of 12 marks or the equivalent, and all chantry priests whose chantries are not assessed or accustomed to pay a tenth (or lay) fifteenth, and which are worth £10 per annum or more.The grant of the graduated poll tax was made on condition: (a) that every bishop certify both the collectors and the Exchequer of the names and surnames of all the priests in his diocese liable to contribute and the amount of their contributions, by 1 May 1430, so that nothing be demanded from the other priests of the diocese whose names and surnames are not contained in the certificates; and (b) that the tax not be collected before the specified payment date.Exempt from payment of the tax were all chaplains and priests who, up to and after Easter last [1429], have been indicted for rape or any other felony by Easter last [1429] or will have been by 1 May 1430, on the certification to both the Exchequer and the collector of the tax, by the relevant bishop of the diocese, \'of the honest conversation and laudable life and good report\' of the indicted clergy, especially regarding the matter for which he has been indicted (|CFR 1422-1430|, p 307). Commissions for collection were issued on 20 February 1430, and the names of the collectors were to be certified to the Exchequer by 25 March 1430. In the diocese of Canterbury, the archdeacon of Canterbury and his official were appointed by the archbishop to collect the tax on 1 April 1430 (E 179/279/22), to which a schedule of names and amounts to be collected was once attached (as stated in the particulars of account: E 179/8/39). The tax was to be paid in full on 1 May 1430.Nominal assessments survive, at least in part, from the dioceses of Canterbury, Bath and Wells, St. David\'s, Ely, Exeter, London, Norwich, Rochester, Salisbury, Winchester and Worcester.  A fragment of a nominal assessment, now thought to relate to this tax, also survives for part of the diocese of Hereford.

Instead, the lower clergy compiled a schedule of proposed reforms to be put before parliament, and the assembly was dissolved.The tenth was granted on condition that: (a) neither the clergy nor their farmers be obliged to pay fifteenths with the laity, or any other secular contribution, on the goods and possessions for which they normally paid clerical tenths, and if any attempt was made to levy a lay tax on them, then they and their farmers would be excused payment of the tenth and in no way bound to pay it at all, and that they shall have a writ from the Exchequer to this effect as often as shall be necessary; (b) that if any collector appointed to levy the tenth certifies the Exchequer, on his oath, that he is unable to collect, or has been prevented from collecting, this tax from the alien priories or other ecclesiastical possessions, goods or benefices in the province, in whosoever hands they may be, even if in the king\'s hands, then that collector will be wholly discharged from making that collection and be quit at the Exchequer, and it will be left to the king and his ministers to collect it, and such collectors shall be no further vexed on that account; (c) that the king shall satisfy the collectors for the spiritualities and temporalities of cathedral churches and religious houses which are in his hands, or those of his farmers or deputies, or otherwise discharge the liability for them in the Exchequer without delay, and that no one who subsequently holds these spiritualities and temporalities shall be charged to pay this tenth; (d) that once the bishop or ordinary of any diocese has appointed someone as collector of the tenth and certified his name to the Exchequer, that he shall not be bound to appoint and certify another person as collector (i.e., in his place), any letters of discharge from collection, made by letters patent of the king, to any cleric of the province, notwithstanding; and (e) that the tax is not to be collected before the specified payment dates.Excused wholly from payment were:(a) the goods, benefices and possessions of all poor religious (i.e. monks and canons), nuns (and canonesses), and other pious places of the province, and the goods, possessions and benefices of all religious and other ecclesiastics within the province, whose monasteries, priories, places, goods, possessions or benefices have been destroyed, much impoverished or excessively diminished by floods, fires, ruin, wars or other accidents, or in any other way, to be certified by the relevant bishop or ordinary;(b) the goods, benefices and possessions of the abbeys of Faversham and Langdon (both in Kent), whose goods \'have lately been excessively diminished by fire\' (|CFR 1437-1445|, p 311);(c) all ecclesiastical benefices that, on account of their poverty, are unofficed, to be certified by the relevant bishop or ordinary;(d) unappropriated ecclesiastical benefices with cure of souls, assessed and accustomed to pay the tenth, the true value of which are 12 marks per annum or less, in which the rectors or vicars, or others by whatsoever name they be known, have resided and do reside continuously in person, or are absent from their benefice because they pursue the study of letters in one of the universities of the realm, having been sufficiently licensed to do so, upon which the relevant bishop is to certify the Exchequer, and such certificates are to be wholly accepted, so that neither the bishops, nor the collectors, nor the persons occupying the said benefices, are to be vexed by the king\'s writs, or in any other way, on this matter;(e) the ecclesiastical goods, possessions and benefices of Eton College (in Buckinghamshire); All Souls College, Oxford; King\'s College, Cambridge; New College, Oxford; and Winchester College (in Winchester); and(f) the benefices, goods and possessions of all rectors, vicars and other beneficed clergy who, between the date of the grant and the date of the last payment of the tax, have been or shall have been indicted for rape or any other felony, on the certification of both the Exchequer and the collector of the tax, by the relevant bishop of the diocese, \'of the honest conversation and good report\' of the indicted clergy, especially regarding the matter upon which he/she has been indicted (|CFR 1437-1445|, p 312).

The tax of 6s.8d. was to be paid by every secular chaplain, friar and other clerics, serving parish churches or receiving stipends and annual payments (|anualia|), and by every other chaplain having chantries unassessed (to pay the tenth).Exempt from payment of the poll tax were: (a) all chaplains studying in the universities of Oxford or Cambridge at the time of the grant; (b) all chaplains living of alms and dwelling in poor hospitals and other poor places; (c) chaplains in Eton College, All Souls College, Oxford, King\'s College, Cambridge, New College, Oxford, and Winchester College (in Winchester); and (d) all secular and religious chaplains from whom the said tax would otherwise be collected, who have been or will have been indicted of rape or another felony between the date of the grant and the date of payment, on condition that the relevant bishop or ordinary certifies the Exchequer of their \'honest conversation, praiseworthy life and good report\', especially with regard to the alleged felony (|CFR 1445-1452], p 141). Commissions for collection of all four taxes were issued on 18 October 1449, and the names of the collectors were to be certified to the Exchequer by 6 December 1449.  The bishops of each diocese were to certify both the Exchequer and the collectors of the poll tax of the names and surnames of the priests liable to pay the tax, so that nothing be demanded from any priests whose names and surnames are not contained in these certificates.  The poll tax was to be paid on 25 March 1450.

Like the other three taxes, it was to be paid not to the Exchequer, but to specially-appointed treasurers and receivers of these taxes, chosen by the clergy themselves - namely John Kemp, archbishop of York, and John Stafford, archbishop of Canterbury, and the bishops of London and Winchester, and their successors in these offices.  These treasurers and receivers, or their deputies, were to receive the proceeds and pay and deliver them to the captains and soldiers appointed by the king, receiving in return, indentures attesting to the receipt of payment from each captain.  The treasurers and receivers were to present these indentures to the Exchequer, when rendering account for the proceeds of the tax, and the Exchequer was to accept them, \'without gift or payment by them of any regard or fees\'.  The treasurers and receivers were to be allowed to disburse the proceeds, any warrant or order to them to the contrary notwithstanding, provided that if these proceeds, or any part of them, were put to uses other than the uses for which they were intended, then the grant of all four taxes would be invalid and null.  Nor were any of the treasurers or receivers to \'incur the displeasure of the king or of any other, or any loss, by colour of the execution\' of their commission.  Another condition of the grant was that no secular clerk be appointed to collect any of the four taxes, and that if any were, then the whole grant would be null and invalid (|CFR 1445-1452|, p 166).Exempt from payment of this tax were the royal colleges (i.e., Eton College, King\'s College, Cambridge and Trinity College, Cambridge), colleges founded by William of Wykeham (i.e., New College, Oxford, and Winchester College, Winchester), Syon Abbey and all houses of the Carthusian order in the province.Commissions for collection of both the quarter of a tenth from exempted collectors, and the subsidy of 2s. in the pound from exempt clergy, were issued on 1 August 1450.  The bishops of each diocese were to certify the names and surnames of all persons liable to pay both the subsidy of a quarter of a tenth, and the subsidy of 2s. in the pound, to both the appointed treasurers and receivers and the collectors of these taxes as quickly as possible.  The archbishop of Canterbury was to make the same certification, and he was also to certify the Exchequer of the same, by 30 September 1450.  These two taxes were both due to be paid immediately.  Although the same collectors might be appointed to collect all four taxes, each was accounted for and enrolled separately.Lists of the names of clergy with possessions in Devon and Cornwall, liable to contribute to the subsidy of 2s. in the pound, were copied into the register of the bishop of Exeter, and a number of assessments from other dioceses survive among the E 179 documents. The particulars of accounts of the collectors in the diocese of Canterbury (E 179/9/59) are also extant.(Wilkins, |Concilia|, III, p 557; |CFR 1445-1452|, pp 163-167; G R Dunstan, |The Register of Edmund Lacy, Bishop of Exeter, 1420-1455 (Canterbury &amp; York Society, 1967), III, pp 49, 77-79; A K McHardy, \'Clerical Taxation in Fifteenth-Century England: The Clergy as Agents of the Crown\', in |The Church, Politics and Patronage in the Fifteenth Century|, ed.

817,1453 Jan 29 ,half a clerical tenth from York province ,Henry VI ,"In response to a royal writ of 7 May 1452, the clergy of the northern province assembled for a synod at York Minster on 12 June 1452.  They sat until 6 October, when the meeting was prorogued, due to the translation of the archbishop of York to the see of Canterbury, the session later resumed, and, finally, on 29 January 1453, the northern clergy granted the king a subsidy of half a tenth of all ecclesiastical goods and benefices, assessed and accustomed to pay the tenth, and dispersed.  The grant was made \'for the defence of the church, realm and people of England, and to meet the costly expenses of the recovery of the city of Bordeaux\' (which the king\'s forces had recently taken by force), \'and the restoration of certain duchies and other places for many years past subject to the rule of the realm of England but at present in rebellion, and the support the other charges of the king\'s majesty\' (|CFR 1452-1461|, p 40).It was granted on condition that: (a) neither the clergy nor their farmers be obliged to pay fifteenths with the laity, or any other secular contribution, on the goods and possessions for which they normally paid clerical tenths, and if any attempt was made to levy a lay tax on them, then they and their farmers would be excused payment of the half a tenth and in no way bound to pay it at all; and (b) that the tax not be collected before the specified dates.Wholly excused from payment of the half a tenth were: (a) the monasteries of Drax, Ferriby, Watton, St. Michael, Hull, and Ellerton (in Yorkshire), and Mattersay, Felley, Blyth and Shelford (in Nottinghamshire), and their goods, benefices and possessions; (b) all monasteries of poor nuns and their goods, benefices and possessions, because of their notorious poverty, to be certified by the relevant bishop or ordinary; (c) the commons of the chapel of St. Mary and the Holy Angels (a chapel adjoining the north side of the nave of York Minster, also known as St. Sepulchre\'s), York and the cathedral church of York (i.e., York Minster), and the churches of Misterton (in Nottinghamshire), Topcliffe and Brodsworth (both in Yorkshire), which are appropriated to York Minster for the completion of the repair of its fabric; and (d) the churches of Ferry Fryston (with its portion), Huntington and Barnbrough (in Yorkshire), a moiety of the church of Treswell (in Nottinghamshire), the prebends of North Leverton in Southwell Minster, Pelton and Lumley in the collegiate church of Chester le Street, and Escomb in the collegiate church of Auckland (in Durham), and the church of Washington (in Durham), because of their excessive assessment; (e) the lands and possessions of the abbey of Meaux (in Yorkshire), which have been destroyed by the waters of the sea and rivers; (f) all priories, monasteries and benefices in Cumberland, Copeland (in Cumberland), Westmorland and Northumberland, and the temporalities and spiritualities annexed to them; and (g) all benefices with cure of souls, assessed by the |Nova Taxatio| or old assessment (i.e., the |Taxatio| of 1291) at 10 marks or less, in regard to which, if the assessment is in doubt, the collectors shall not be charged unless it is first found by inquisition of the bishop or ordinary that the benefice in question has been assessed at a greater sum, so that neither the bishops or ordinaries, nor the collectors, nor the occupants of the benefices be vexed or grieved in any way by the king\'s officers.Receiving exemption from one half of the levy, and paying thus only one quarter of a tenth, were: (a) the monasteries of Worksop, Thurgarton, Newstead and Welbeck (in Nottinghamshire), Marton, Monkbretton, Roche, Pontefract, Bolton in Craven, Haltemprice, Egglestone and Holy Trinity, York (in Yorkshire), and Cockersand (in Lancashire), and all their goods, benefices and possessions in the province; (b) the churches of Kilvington, Babworth and Leake (in Nottinghamshire), Winston (in Durham), Kirkham (in Lancashire), and South Dalton and Kirby Wiske (in Yorkshire); and (c) the prebends of Langtoft in York Minster, East Stoke (Stoke by Newark) and Edingley in Southwell Minster, and Saltmarsh in the collegiate church of Howden, and the temporalities of the provost of the collegiate church of Beverley and the parish church of Welwick (in Yorkshire), annexed to the said provost, the latter because of the \'dreadful and unwonted storms of the sea and the Humber\', and their excessive assessment.  Commissions for collection were issued on 12 June 1453, and the names of the collectors were to be certified to the Exchequer by 1 November 1453.

For the first time, the grant of the alien subsidy included the provision that landlords were to be held responsible for the tax due from aliens who fled after assessment and before collection of the tax.  Even though the returns of this tax were poor (only one assessment was returned into the Exchequer), and many collectors appeared at the Exchequer claiming exoneration for sums uncollectable because the aliens assessed had fled, this provision was not invoked; defaulting aliens themselves were charged rather than their landlords.There are no enrolled accounts of this tax, but on the basis of other surviving records, Dr. Schofield found that at least £774 4s.1d. was received.(|Rot.

233,1497 Jan 16 x March 13 ,two fifteenths and tenths ,Henry VII ,"A loan of £120,000 approved at a great council which met between 24 October and 6 November 1496 anticipated a grant of the same sum by the parliament which was summoned to meet in January 1497.  The parliament opened on 16 January, and on or before 13 March 1497, when it was dissolved, granted roughly half that sum in the form of two fifteenths and tenths, subject to the usual deduction of £6,000 per fifteenth and tenth, for impoverished towns, and full exemptions of specific towns.The first fifteenth and tenth was payable on 31 May 1497, and the second on 8 November 1497.  The grant of the second fifteenth and tenth was conditional; if the king did not lead an army to Scotland and a peace was concluded, then it would not be levied.  If a temporary truce was agreed, then the levy of the second fifteenth and tenth would be suspended, but if war then later broke out, the grant of the second fifteenth and tenth would hold good, and the tax would be leviable.  In such a case, however, the second fifteenth and tenth was not to be assessed locally until after 15 August, but by Michaelmas (29 September), and was not leviable until 15 October 1497, the names of the collectors having been certified into the Exchequer by 1 October.  Commissions to the collectors for the first fifteenth and tenth were issued on 15 March 1497, and for the second on 1 November 1497 (E 179/184/125; E179/91/86).The E 179 documents contain conflicting information about the date of the levy of the second fifteenth and tenth.  The account of the county collectors in Surrey cites a payment date of 8 November 1497, as do those for the City of York, Lincolnshire, Norwich, London and Dorset for which letters patent were issued on 1 November 1497 (E 179/184/127; 217/86; 136/286, 288-9; 149/198; 144/81; 103/114).  A certificate of exemption for the Cinque Port barons of Hythe, dated 16 February 1498, however, states that the second payment was due in the feast of St. Gregory the Pope in 13 Henry VII (12 March 1498) (E 179/232/284, m. 25).  That the Essex and Norwich accounts were not audited until Michaelmas term 1498 (E 179/108/137), and that for Derbyshire in Trinity term 1499 (E 179/91/85), suggests further that the second fifteenth and tenth may have been levied after the date mandated in the parliamentary grant.(|Rot.

234,1504 Jan 25 ,"subsidy of £30,000 in lieu of two feudal aids ",Henry VII ,"Parliament opened on 25 January 1504 and the king attempted to secure a grant of two aids - one for knighting his eldest son, Prince Arthur, and another for the marriage of his eldest daughter, Princess Margaret.  Arthur was knighted back in 1489 and had been dead for nearly two years, and Margaret had already married James IV of Scotland in the previous year, but nevertheless, the commons acknowledged that the king was \'rightfully intitled\' to have them.  What the commons did object to was an investigation into feudal tenures, which \'shuld be to theym, doubtefull, uncerteyn and great inquietness\'.  The king\'s interest in exploiting his feudal rights for profit is attested by the increased activity in enforcing feudal incidents from 1502, noticed by R.S. Schofield is his study of Exchequer memoranda rolls (E 368/276, 277, 278).  It was probably also around this time that the king had all the returns for the 1428 subsidy on parishes and knights\' fees copied and bound into one volume - now E 164/4 (see above).  The commons offered considerable opposition to these aids, and mindful of the Cornish rebellion, Henry VII was persuaded instead to accept a grant of £40,000, for the defence of the realm.  Of this sum, he wisely remitted £10,000.The amounts allocated to each county were listed at the end of the statute.  Dr. Schofield has noted that these amounts represent the totals apportioned to each county for the levy of the fifteenth and tenth in 1334, adjusted for the deductions made for decayed areas, which had become standard in the fifteenth century, and the inclusion of the northern border counties.The minimum thresholds of liability and assessment procedure were much the same as for the 1497 subsidy.  Those in possession of freehold land of 20s. annual value or more were liable, but the threshold for tenants of land \'held at will\' was 26s.8d. per annum.  As before, those with goods and chattels worth 10 marks and above, excluding their ploughs and household stuffs, were taxable.  The same rates of taxation were to be applied to all three categories of wealth.  Clerics and aliens, as in 1497, were to be charged as for a fifteenth and tenth, and the universities, the colleges of Eton and Winchester, the Carthusian houses and Syon Abbey were exempt altogether.The commissioners were appointed by parliament and are listed in the printed statute.  The assessments were to be completed by 29 September, appointment of the collectors was to be made by the commissioners and certified into the Exchequer by 1 November, and the tax was to be collected by 30 November 1504.  A file of certificates of the appointment of collectors in most cities and counties exists at E 179/241/364.At £30,929, the total yield of the tax was slightly higher than that collected in 1497.(|Rot.

482,1491 July 7 ,benevolence ,Henry VII ,"Ignoring the statute passed in 1484 which freed the king\'s subjects from the imposition of benevolences, Henry VII issued commissions on 7 July 1491 to negotiate for \'assistance\' from his subjects to fund a French campaign, following a meeting of his great council in June.  The instructions to the commissioners allowed them much discretion, authorising them to seek contributions from the the king\'s subjects, \'each one according to his means\'.The money was collected in the following year to finance the king\'s expedition to Boulogne, though much remained unpaid for many years.  A statute passed in 1495 ordered the collection of arrears of the benevolence.  The wording of that statute implies that promissory notes had been accepted initially, but that many had not made good on these, and that some money which had been collected remained in the hands of the collectors or commissioners.  Commissioners were given the authority to execute Exchequer process against the defaulters to secure payment.  Those collectors who still withheld money that they had received, after a date specified by the appointed receivers, were liable to be incarcerated until satisfaction was made.  A receipt issued to the Archbishop of Canterbury for his contribution of £1,500 was dated 27 June 1496.The money was paid to the king\'s treasurer of war, Reginald Bray.  The account of receipts and expenditures for the expedition, rendered by his deputy, gives the total received as £48,498.16s.8d.declared account: E 36/285(|CPR 1485-1494|, pp 353-355; |The Reign of Henry VII from Contemporary Sources|, ed.

580,1496 Oct 24 x Nov 6 ,forced loan ,Henry VII ,"Henry VII convened a great council between 24 October and 6 November 1496 to discuss a feared invasion by the Scots, and a levy of £120,000 was approved, initially as a loan.  Lenders would be promised repayment from a subsidy to be granted by the parliament which was to be summoned in January 1497.Form letters were issued under the signet on 1 December 1496 and sent to targeted individuals.  Several of these survive (E 34/3, 4; BL, Cotton MS Titus B.V, fo 155), and one which was formerly among the muniments of Christ Church Priory, Canterbury, has been printed in two sources.The letter stressed the danger posed by the Scots and the approval of \'our grete councyell, of lordes spirituall and temporall, of juges, serjeaunts in the lawe, and of others\' of the levy.  The lords and other members of the great council had already contributed \'grete somes of money\', but some £40,000 more was still necessary for the planned two royal armies to be raised.  The recipient of the letter was enjoined to lend a certain sum before Candlemas (2 February 1497), bringing it to the Exchequer of Receipt and paying it to one of the tellers, who would in return provide him with a \'bille of mutuum\'.  Upon presentation of this bill at the \'feste of Seynt Andrewe next comyng\' (28 November 1497), the lender would be reimbursed, free of charge.The letter used both persuasion and coercion, stating that it was \'a thing of so grete weight and importance as may not be fayled, and therefore fayle ye not...as ye entende the gode and honour of us and of this our roialme, and as ye tendre also the wele and suertie of yourself\'.  Most of the letters in E 34 contain the name of the addressee on the dorse.  The amounts demanded and the county of the addressee\'s residence were initially left blank and filled in later, as appropriate.  These letters, which had obviously been returned to the Exchequer, contain verification at the bottom that the addressee had agreed to pay the amount requested and the signature of one or more local commissioners, such as is the case with a similar letter sent to the abbess of Barking and signed by the Essex commissioners (BL, Cotton MS Cleo. F.VI, fos. 247v-248).The \'king\'s book of payments\', maintained by the treasurer of the chamber, John Heron, contains repayments of these loans totalling at least £47,344 between December 1497 and June 1498 (E 101/415/3, fos. 9, 21, 29, 31v).(Chrimes, |Henry VII|, p 144; |Christchurch Letters|, ed.

581,1489 Feb 23 ,"subsidy of £75,000 from the laity ",Henry VII ,"In November 1488 a meeting of the king\'s great council was convened which discussed and authorised the levy of a subsidy of a tenth, or income tax, of one year\'s issues on lands, annuities and offices, in order to finance a proposed military expedition to aid Brittany.  It was hoped to raise £100,000 in this way.Parliament was always reluctant to grant taxes without fixed total yields, as these ran the danger of exceeding the amount produced by the levy of fifteenths and tenths, and therefore costing them more money; such grants also weakened their control over the taxation process.  In the parliament which opened on 13 January 1489, therefore, an overall sum had to be agreed to procure the assent of the commons.  The compromise sum of £75,000 was concorded, with the clergy (of the province of Canterbury) to provide the remaining £25,000.  If the expeditionary forces remained abroad longer and the £100,000 proved inadequate, the tax would be renewed for up to two more years.  The act granting the subsidy to the king was passed on 23 February 1489.Like that granted in 1472, the subsidy was in the form of two separate grants, one by the commons and the other by the lords.  The grant made by the commons provided for a tax of one-tenth of the annual income of all honours, castles, lordships, manors, lands, tenements, rents, fees, annuities, corrodies and other pensions, fee farms and the temporal lands of the clergy, and 1s.8d. for every 10 marks worth of moveable goods.  The lords also granted a tenth of their income from lands and offices, which included those being held by others to their use.  The queen, the merchants of Castile, Venice, Genoa, Florence, Lucca and the Hanse, and the counties of Cumberland, Westmorland and Northumberland were to be exempt from the tax.  The assessment of the tax on goods was to take place between 25 March and 19 April, and the tax was payable by 1 May 1489.  The tax on lands was to be paid in two instalments, the first of which conformed to this same timetable.  Assessment of the second half of the tax on lands was to begin on 29 September, with payment due on 1 November 1489.The procedure laid down for assessment and collection was virtually identical with that prescribed for the subsidy of 1472.  Commissioners were to be appointed by the king to carry out valuations of net incomes and the capital value of goods, according to their discretion, \'by examination, inquiries or other reasonable means\'.  Only the net annual income from all lands, offices, etc., after deductions for rents, fees and services had been made, was to be assessed.  The assessment of goods was to include all stocks of merchandise held for trade, but personal apparel, household necessities, and coined money and plate for personal use were exempt, as were sea-going ships and their tackle.  A taxpayer was to be assessed only in the place \'where he is most conversaunt\'.In making these assessments, however, it is clear that the assessors used the quotas allocated to specific townships for fifteenths and tenths to gauge their assessments.  A paper book containing the assessment of the hundred of Godalming in Surrey bears marginal annotations to remind the assessors of the amounts paid by each township in the levy of the fifteenth (Surrey Record Office, Guildford, LM 1499/2).The commissioners, whose appointment was not enrolled in Chancery, were to appoint collectors, make indentures with them, listing the amounts assessed and the names of the persons from whom the respective sums were to be collected; these indentures would also serve as warrants for collection.  Collectors were instructed to distrain and sell either the land or goods of those who defaulted payment.  Those whose assets were not distrainable, either because no distrainable goods could be found, or because the assessed income was in the form of offices or annuities, and who had not made payment within fifteen days of the payment date, were to pay double the amount assessed, and were liable to Exchequer process against them to obtain payment.  The collectors were to certify the details of the defaulters into the Exchequer and, unlike the accounting procedure for the levy of a fifteenth and tenth, were thereafter to be discharged from responsibility for the sums in their accounts.  Process would be issued against the defaulters in the Exchequer, with the execution of that process put into the hands of the sheriffs.  Negligent or defaulting collectors would also be liable to proceedings against them by the Exchequer, and would be imprisoned until they made fine for the amount owed.As in 1472, the commons were determined to keep their financial affairs their own business, and similarly insisted that the \'details of private wealth that would be assessed were never to come into the possession of the crown, and no records of assessment were to be returned to the Exchequer or any other court of record\'.  Nor was the total amount assessed in any area to be certified to the Exchequer, but to parliament.  The money itself was not to be paid into the Exchequer or any other central treasury, but to be held on deposit in designated repositories (i.e., castles, towns, abbeys, etc.) until the king sent for it.  The tax was not to be a precedent for any other grant of taxation.  The grant was also closely tied to military operations.  If the military need were reduced, the grant was to be reduced in proportion, but if the campaign continued longer than anticipated, and expenses rose above £100,000, then the tax would be levied for a further two years, with an annual limit of £25,000 imposed.Despite the prohibition on the return of assessments to the Exchequer, a few ended up there.  Three transcripts of inquisitions held in Norfolk are among the E 179 records (E 179/149/184 - 187, and E 179/151/353), probably brought in by the cellarer of the abbey of Bury St Edmunds when he delivered the money collected in Norfolk and Suffolk, as recorded in E 36/125, fo 143 and E 179/280/27.  Copies of other assessments survive in BL, Stowe MS 880, fos. 44-45 (lordship of Newborough and Horecross, Staffs.) and Surrey Record Office, Guildford, LM 1499/2 (Godalming hundred, Surrey).  The original assessment of the borough of Leicester, dated 2 May 1489, is printed in |Records of the Borough of Leicester|, ed. M. Bateson, II, (London, 1901), pp. 331-335, where it is mis-dated to 1492.  A list of collectors and commissioners in Shropshire who had not yet sent in their certificates also exists at E 179/166/111, but in general the attempt of the commons to prevent the disclosure of their true wealth to the Exchequer was successful.For the most part, however, the collectors of the subsidy paid the money directly into the Exchequer of Receipt.  Of the £27,000 estimated by parliament to have been collected, £18,300 7s.11 1/2d. was received there (E 401/965-967, 970-972, 974, 978; E 405/78).  At least two local repositories were used to store the money paid to the collectors - the abbey of Bury St Edmunds and St. Mary\'s Abbey in York - and in neither case did the money remain on the premises, but was paid into the Exchequer, to the treasurer of the chamber, or to military paymasters.  Collectors in other counties gave their takings to government officials, such as sheriffs (as in Derbyshire), the king\'s avener (as in Devon and Cornwall), or to the king\'s councillor Richard Empson (as in Northamptonshire).  Although only three Lincolnshire collectors are known to have accounted before auditors, Roger Schofield has suggested that fear of being required to account at a later date, and the understandable desire to obtain a traditional form of discharge from liability, explains why most collectors failed to adhere to the collection procedure mandated by parliament and paid the money into the Exchequer.On 15 February 1490, with parliament still in session, the king agreed to remit to the laity the remainder of the tax that was still to be collected, some £48,000, in exchange for the grant of a fifteenth and tenth.The failure of the tax to raise more than £27,000 (of which Dr. Schofield could trace only £20,736 12s.) was attributed by contemporary chroniclers to the costs of collection and \'the favour of the commissioners\' in making the assessments too low.  In concurring with this judgment, Schofield notes that suspiciously few assessments were on goods.  Resistance to the tax was another factor.  In Yorkshire, the levy of the tax played some part in fomenting a rebellion.  As there was no minimum threshold of liability, the tax hit many lower-income payers hard.  This can be seen in R.W. Hoyle\'s figures given for the wapentake of Claro.  In 1489, there were 1,001 contributors, as opposed to only about 410 named in the subsidy assessed in 1524 and 1525.  This feature was not be repeated in future such levies. (NB: the assessment for Claro wapentake was mis-identified by Hoyle; it is an assessment for the 1472 subsidy.)(|Rot.

584,1497 Jan 16 x March 13 ,"subsidy of £62,000 ",Henry VII ,"The two fifteenths and tenths granted in the parliament that opened on 16 January 1497 were inadequate for the purpose for which they were granted - the defence of the realm from an invasion of the Scots.  Later in the same session, perhaps as late as 13 March, the day upon which parliament was dissolved, therefore, the commons granted an additional \'aide and subsidy\' which was to be equal to the amount of two fifteenths and tenths, minus the standard deduction of £6,000 per fifteenth and tenth - a total sum of £62,000.  Together with the two fifteenths and tenths already granted, therefore, the projected yield was roughly the same as the £120,000 sanctioned by Henry VII\'s council.The tax was in effect a compromise between the traditional fifteenths and tenths, in guaranteeing a fixed amount, and a graduated income tax.  Each county was charged with the same total sums which would have been allocated to them in the levy of two fifteenths and tenths, and the hardship deductions rebated to the various townships within the county were to be subtracted from its share accordingly.  However, the traditional division of the county total amongst the vills was abandoned.  Instead, the subsidy was to be levied upon all persons possessing a landed estate (held in fee simple, fee tail or freely held at will) of 20s. per annum or more, or anyone seised with goods and chattels worth 10 marks or more.  The amount payable by each such person was at the discretion of the commissioners appointed in the statute, who, together with the county justices of the peace, or the mayors, sheriffs and bailiffs of the cities and boroughs, were to assess all liable persons, after taking the advices and assistance of other \'discrete persones\' dwelling in the county.Although Cheshire was not normally included in taxation in the medieval period on the grounds that the county was not represented in Parliament, it seems that a mise of 1000 marks was levied in Cheshire in 1497 for the same reasons as this subsidy, to fight the Scots.  This may represent an attempt to widen the scope of revenue raising in time of need to areas not taxed as a general rule.Because the levy was a fixed amount overall, assessments did not have to be made as accurately as had been the case in 1489.  The London commissioners accordingly grouped all liable persons into \'4 degrees of berers and payers\'.  There was no procedure established to appeal the assessments made in the case of wrongful or disputed assessments.  The same commissioners were to appoint collectors.  The names of the collectors of the first half of the subsidy were to be returned into the Exchequer before the morrow of Ascension (5 May 1497).  Clerics and aliens were to be charged as for fifteenths and tenths, and the universities, and the colleges of Eton and Winchester, were exempt altogether.  A file of certificates of appointment of collectors in most cities and counties, for the levy of the first half of the subsidy, exists at E 179/241/365.The collectors were empowered to begin collection on 13 May, and payment was due by 31 May.  They were also authorised to distrain and sell goods or, in the case of lands, take rents for up to half a year, but no longer, until the tax was paid thereby, but distresses could only be levied upon the goods or lands on which the defaulter had been assessed.  In cases where no distress could be found, he would be compelled to pay double the amount assessed against him, upon pain of imprisonment without bail, within fifteen days.  The collectors\' intention to certify defaulters to the Exchequer had to be publicly proclaimed in the nearest market town, however.  Dr. Schofield found record of 195 defaulters, all but one of whom were double-assessed.  In the event of a \'rescue\' of a distress taken, justices of the peace had the power to imprison such rescuers without bail until the distress was repaid.  The second half of the subsidy was payable on 8 November 1497, and like the second of the two fifteenths and tenths, its grant was conditional.  It was not to be levied if the king did not lead an army to Scotland and a peace was instead concluded.  If a temporary truce was agreed, then the levy would be suspended, but if war then later broke out, the grant was to be put into effect and the tax would be levied.  In the latter case, however, the second half was not to be assessed until after 15 August, but by Michaelmas (29 September), and was not leviable until 15 October 1497, the names of the collectors having been certified into the Exchequer by 1 October.In the event, the tax sparked a rebellion in Cornwall, and the Scottish campaign did not come off.  The second half of the tax was never levied, therefore, and the total sum (net) received by the crown for the tax was only £30,735.(|Rot.

861,1487 Feb 26 or earlier ,clerical tenth from Canterbury province ,Henry VII ,"In response to a royal writ of 16 November 1486, the clergy of the southern province assembled in convocation at St. Paul\'s, London, on 13 February 1487.  A delegation from the king\'s council, led by the treasurer of England, John, Lord Dinham, paid a visit to the archbishop on 19 or 20 February.  On behalf of the king, Lord Dinham thanked the clergy for their benevolence and prayers, and asked them to maintain these.  He then demonstrated the extent of the kin\'s expenditure for the defence of the realm and church in England, and for measures against the rebels, and asked for a grant of a subsidy.  The archbishop replied that he would discuss the matter with convocation and convey its answer to the king.  On 25 or 26 February, the elected speaker for the lower clergy presented four schedules to the archbishop, one of which contained the proposed grant of a subsidy of a tenth to the king, and, apparently on the same day, the text of the grant was agreed.  The convocation was adjourned on 26 February.  The subsidy granted was a tenth on the ecclesiastical goods, benefices and possessions, assessed and accustomed to pay the tenth, a tenth on unassessed goods, benefices and possessions, and a tenth on the ecclesiastical goods, benefices and possessions of alien priories.The tenth on assessed benefices was granted on condition: (a) that once the bishop or ordinary of any diocese has appointed someone as collector of the tenth and certified his name to the Exchequer, that he shall not be bound to appoint and certify another person as collector (i.e., in his place), any letters of discharge from collection, made by letters patent of the king, to any cleric of the province, notwithstanding; (b) that if any regular person (i.e., monk), having been appointed by the ordinary to collect the tenth or any part of it, refuses to undertake the charge of such collection, then he shall be charged with another moiety of a tenth to be paid to the king, on account of his refusal, and nevertheless be compelled to levy and collect the said tenth or moiety, according to the appointment made by his ordinary, provided that the monastery or house of that regular person so appointed be situated within the diocese of the bishop making the appointment; (c) that no persons present in the lower house of the convocation in which the tax was granted, whether in their own names or as proctors, will be appointed to collect it; (d) that if any collector appointed to levy the tenths certifies the Exchequer, on his oath, that from the time that the grant was made up to the date upon which the last payment is due he has been unable to collect, or has been prevented from collecting this tax from any ecclesiastical possessions, goods or benefices in the province, then that collector will be wholly discharged from making that collection and be quit at the Exchequer, and it will be left to the king and his ministers to collect it; (e) that every collector appointed by the ordinary to collect the tenth or any part of it, when rendering his account at the Exchequer, shall have for his labours and expenses as much money as he has expended in making his collection (his oath to be accepted on the matter, without further inquisition), or 12d. of every pound collected by him for the tenth, and he shall be satisfied with such remuneration without seeking further reward in this behalf; and (f) that the tenth will not be collected before the specified payment dates.Excused wholly from payment were:(a) the goods, benefices and possessions of all poor religious (i.e. monks and canons), nuns (and canonesses), and other pious places of the province, and the goods, possessions and benefices of all religious and other ecclesiastics within the province, whose monasteries, priories, places, goods, possessions or benefices have been (or from the day of the grant of the said tenth up to the time of the last payment of the same shall be) destroyed, much impoverished or excessively diminished by floods, fires, ruin, wars or other accidents, or in any other way, to be certified by the relevant bishop or ordinary, from time to time up to the last day of payment;(b) the goods, benefices and possessions of the priory of Butley (in Suffolk), the priories of Westacre, West Dereham and Castleacre (in Norfolk), the abbey of Bermondsey (in Surrey), the priory of St. Bartholomew, London, the abbey of Lesnes and the secular college of Cobham (in Kent), the master and brethren of the hospital of St. Thomas Acon (in London), the priory of St. Frideswide\'s, Oxford (in Oxfordshire), the priory of Daventry (in Northamptonshire), the priory of Hertford (in Hertfordshire), the priory of Bradenstoke (in Somerset), the abbey of Milton (in Dorset), the priory of Tortington (in Sussex), the abbey of Merevale (in Warwickshire), the abbey of Whalley (in Lancashire), the abbey of Haughmond (in Shropshire), and the abbey of Bordesley (in Worcestershire);(c) all ecclesiastical benefices that, on account of their poverty, are unofficed, to be certified by the relevant bishop or ordinary;(d) unappropriated ecclesiastical benefices with cure of souls, whether assessed or not assessed, and not accustomed to pay the tenth, the true value of which are 12 marks per annum or less, in which the rectors or vicars, or others by whatsoever name they be known, have resided and do reside continuously in person, to be certified by the relevant bishop or ordinary, or if absent from the same, effectively pursue the study of letters at one of the universities of the realm, having been sufficiently licensed for it, upon which the relevant bishop is to certify the Exchequer, and such certificates are to be wholly accepted without any other inquisition, investigation or delay;(e) the ecclesiastical goods, possessions and benefices of all colleges or collegiate halls in the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, Eton College (in Buckinghamshire), and Winchester College (in Winchester);(f) the benefices, goods and possessions of all rectors, vicars and other beneficed clergy who, after 11 March 1485 (the last day of the last convocation) and before the date of the grant, and up to the time of the last payment of the tenth, shall have been indicted, accused or imprisoned by lay persons or by the lay power for any felony or trespass or on any other charge, on the certification of the relevant bishop or ordinary;(g) the goods, benefices and possessions of Syon Abbey (in Middlesex), the priory of Sheen (in Surrey), the London Charterhouse and all other Carthusian houses in the province;(h) the parish church of Sutton (in Surrey);

(b) that if any regular person (i.e., monk), having been appointed by the ordinary to collect the tenth or any part of it, refuses to undertake the charge of such collection, then he shall be charged with another moiety of a tenth to be paid to the king, on account of his refusal, and nevertheless be compelled to levy and collect the said tenth or moiety, according to the appointment made by his ordinary, provided that the monastery or house of that regular person so appointed be situated within the diocese of the bishop making the appointment; (c) that no persons present in the lower house of the convocation in which the tax was granted, whether in their own names or as proctors, will be appointed to collect it; (d) that if any collector appointed to levy the tenths certifies the Exchequer, on his oath, that from the time that the grant was made up to the date upon which the last payment is due he has been unable to collect, or has been prevented from collecting this tax from any ecclesiastical possessions, goods or benefices in the province, then that collector will be wholly discharged from making that collection and be quit at the Exchequer, and it will be left to the king and his ministers to collect it; (e) that every collector appointed by the ordinary to collect the tenth or any part of it, when rendering his account at the Exchequer, shall have for his labours and expenses as much money as he has expended in making his collection (his oath to be accepted on the matter, without further inquisition), or 12d. of every pound collected by him for the tenth, and he shall be satisfied with such remuneration without seeking further reward in this behalf; and (f) that the tenth will not be collected before the specified payment dates.Excused wholly from payment were:(a) the goods, benefices and possessions of all poor religious (i.e. monks and canons), nuns (and canonesses), and other pious places of the province, and the goods, possessions and benefices of all religious and other ecclesiastics within the province, whose monasteries, priories, places, goods, possessions or benefices have been (or from the day of the grant of the said tenth up to the time of the last payment of the same shall be) destroyed, much impoverished or excessively diminished by floods, fires, ruin, wars or other accidents, or in any other way, to be certified by the relevant bishop or ordinary, from time to time up to the last day of payment;(b) the goods, benefices and possessions of the priory of Butley (in Suffolk), the priories of Westacre, West Dereham and Castleacre (in Norfolk), the abbey of Bermondsey (in Surrey), the priory of St. Bartholomew, London, the abbey of Lesnes and the secular college of Cobham (in Kent), the master and brethren of the hospital of St. Thomas Acon (in London), the priory of St. Frideswide\'s, Oxford (in Oxfordshire), the priory of Daventry (in Northamptonshire), the priory of Hertford (in Hertfordshire), the priory of Bradenstoke (in Somerset), the abbey of Milton (in Dorset), the priory of Tortington (in Sussex), the abbey of Merevale (in Warwickshire), the abbey of Whalley (in Lancashire), the abbey of Haughmond (in Shropshire), and the abbey of Bordesley (in Worcestershire);(c) all ecclesiastical benefices that, on account of their poverty, are unofficed, to be certified by the relevant bishop or ordinary;(d) unappropriated ecclesiastical benefices with cure of souls, whether assessed or not assessed, and not accustomed to pay the tenth, the true value of which are 12 marks per annum or less, in which the rectors or vicars, or others by whatsoever name they be known, have resided and do reside continuously in person, to be certified by the relevant bishop or ordinary, or if absent from the same, effectively pursue the study of letters at one of the universities of the realm, having been sufficiently licensed for it, upon which the relevant bishop is to certify the Exchequer, and such certificates are to be wholly accepted without any other inquisition, investigation or delay;(e) the ecclesiastical goods, possessions and benefices of all colleges or collegiate halls in the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, Eton College (in Buckinghamshire), and Winchester College (in Winchester);(f) the benefices, goods and possessions of all rectors, vicars and other beneficed clergy who, after 11 March 1485 (the last day of the last convocation) and before the date of the grant, and up to the time of the last payment of the tenth, shall have been indicted, accused or imprisoned by lay persons or by the lay power for any felony or trespass or on any other charge, on the certification of the relevant bishop or ordinary;(g) the goods, benefices and possessions of Syon Abbey (in Middlesex), the priory of Sheen (in Surrey), the London Charterhouse and all other Carthusian houses in the province;(h) the parish church of Sutton (in Surrey);

863,1487 Feb 26 or earlier ,"clerical tenth on alien priories, Canterbury province ",Henry VII ,"In response to a royal writ of 16 November 1486, the clergy of the southern province assembled in convocation at St. Paul\'s, London, on 13 February 1487.  A delegation from the king\'s council, led by the treasurer of England, John, Lord Dinham, paid a visit to the archbishop on 19 or 20 February.  On behalf of the king, Lord Dinham thanked the clergy for their benevolence and prayers, and asked them to maintain these.  He then demonstrated the extent of the kin\'s expenditure for the defence of the realm and church in England, and for measures against the rebels, and asked for a grant of a subsidy.  The archbishop replied that he would discuss the matter with convocation and convey its answer to the king.  On 25 or 26 February, the elected speaker for the lower clergy presented four schedules to the archbishop, one of which contained the proposed grant of a subsidy of a tenth to the king, and, apparently on the same day, the text of the grant was agreed.  The convocation was adjourned on 26 February.  The subsidy granted was a tenth on the ecclesiastical goods, benefices and possessions, assessed and accustomed to pay the tenth, a tenth on unassessed goods, benefices and possessions, and a tenth on the ecclesiastical goods, benefices and possessions of alien priories.The tenth on the goods, benefices and possessions of alien priories was granted on condition: (a) that once the bishop or ordinary of any diocese has appointed someone as collector of the tenth and certified his name to the Exchequer, that he shall not be bound to appoint and certify another person as collector (i.e., in his place), any letters of discharge from collection, made by letters patent of the king, to any cleric of the province, notwithstanding; (b) that if any regular person (i.e., monk), having been appointed by the ordinary to collect the tenth or any part of it, refuses to undertake the charge of such collection, then he shall be charged with another moiety of a tenth to be paid to the king, on account of his refusal, and nevertheless be compelled to levy and collect the said tenth or moiety, according to the appointment made by his ordinary, provided that the monastery or house of that regular person so appointed be situated within the diocese of the bishop making the appointment; (c) that no persons present in the lower house of the convocation in which the tax was granted, whether in their own names or as proctors, will be appointed to collect it; (d) that if any collector appointed to levy the tenths certifies the Exchequer, on his oath, that from the time that the grant was made up to the date upon which the last payment is due he has been unable to collect, or has been prevented from collecting this tax from any ecclesiastical possessions, goods or benefices in the province, then that collector will be wholly discharged from making that collection and be quit at the Exchequer, and it will be left to the king and his ministers to collect it; (e) that every collector appointed by the ordinary to collect the tenth or any part of it, when rendering his account at the Exchequer, shall have for his labours and expenses as much money as he has expended in making his collection (his oath to be accepted on the matter, without further inquisition), or 12d. of every pound collected by him for the tenth, and he shall be satisfied with such remuneration without seeking further reward in this behalf; and (f) that the tenth will not be collected before the specified payment dates.Excused wholly from payment were:(a) the goods, benefices and possessions of all poor religious (i.e. monks and canons), nuns (and canonesses), and other pious places of the province, and the goods, possessions and benefices of all religious and other ecclesiastics within the province, whose monasteries, priories, places, goods, possessions or benefices have been (or from the day of the grant of the said tenth up to the time of the last payment of the same shall be) destroyed, much impoverished or excessively diminished by floods, fires, ruin, wars or other accidents, or in any other way, to be certified by the relevant bishop or ordinary, from time to time up to the last day of payment;(b) all ecclesiastical benefices that, on account of their poverty, are unofficed, to be certified by the relevant bishop or ordinary;(c) unappropriated ecclesiastical benefices with cure of souls, whether assessed or not assessed, and not accustomed to pay the tenth, the true value of which are 12 marks per annum or less, in which the rectors or vicars, or others by whatsoever name they be known, have resided and do reside continuously in person, to be certified by the relevant bishop or ordinary, or if absent from the same, effectively pursue the study of letters at one of the universities of the realm, having been sufficiently licensed for it, upon which the relevant bishop is to certify the Exchequer, and such certificates are to be wholly accepted without any other inquisition, investigation or delay; and(d) the benefices, goods and possessions of all rectors, vicars and other beneficed clergy who, after 11 March 1485 (the last day of the last convocation) and before the date of the grant, and up to the time of the last payment of the tenth, shall have been indicted, accused or imprisoned by lay persons or by the lay power for any felony or trespass or on any other charge, on the certification of the relevant bishop or ordinary.Commissions for collection were issued on 13 April 1487, and the names of the collectors were to be certified to the Exchequer by 25 May 1487.

864,1487 Feb 19 x Aug 31 ,clerical tenth from York province ,Henry VII ,"In response to a royal writ of 16 December 1486, the clergy of the province of York were summoned to a convocation at York on 19 February 1487.  The archbishop, who was apparently present, exhorted the clergy to make a grant of a subsidy to the king \'with all possible diligence\'.  It is not known how long the assembly remained in session.  The text of the tax grant states only that a tax was granted unanimously \'after many discussions\'.  These may have been lengthy, however, since it was not until 31 August that the king was notified of the northern clergy\'s grant to him of a tenth of all ecclesiastical goods, benefices and possessions assessed and accustomed to pay the tenth.  The tax was granted on condition that it would not be collected before the specified dates of payment (|CFR 1485-1509|, p 74).Wholly excused from payment of the tax were:(a) the monasteries of Drax, Ferriby, Monkbretton, St. Michael, Hull, Helagh Park, Begar, Watton and Ellerton (in Yorkshire), and Mattersay, Felley, Blyth and Shelford (in Nottinghamshire), and their goods, benefices and possessions;(b) all monasteries of poor nuns and their goods, benefices and possessions, because of their notorious poverty, to be certified by the relevant bishop or ordinary;(c) the commons of the chapel of St. Mary and the Holy Angels (a chapel adjoining the north side of the nave of York Minster, also known as St. Sepulchre\'s), York, the collegiate church of Howden, and the cathedral church of York (i.e., York Minster), the parish church of Sturton (in Lincolnshire), appropriated to York Minster, the common of the collegiate church of St John of Beverley (i.e. Beverley Minster), with the sacristy of the same church, the churches of Misterton (in Nottinghamshire), Topcliffe and Brodsworth (both in Yorkshire), which are all appropriated to York Minster for the completion of the repair of its fabric, the churches of Ferry Fryston (with its portion, appropriated to the vicars choral of York Minster), Huntington (in Yorkshire), Kneesall (in Nottinghamshire), appropriated to the vicars choral of Southwell Minster, Wollaton (in Nottinghamshire) and Barnbrough (in Yorkshire), the prebend of North Leverton in Southwell Minster (on account of its excessive assessment), the common of Southwell Minster, the church of Barnby in the Willows (in Nottinghamshire) (appropriated to the use of the choristers of Southwell Minster), and the church of Washington (in Durham);(d) the lands and possessions of the abbey of Meaux (in Yorkshire), which have been destroyed by the sea;(e) the parish church of Seaham (in Durham), appropriated to the priory of Coverham (in Yorkshire), \'for the speedy construction of the same monastery and on account of the notorious poverty of the same\';(f) the portion of Escomb in the collegiate church of Auckland (in Durham);(g) all priories, monasteries and benefices in Cumberland, Copeland (in Cumberland), Westmorland and Northumberland, and the temporalities and spiritualities annexed to them;(h) all benefices, curacies, dignities, prebends, hospitals, pensions and portions assessed by the |Nova Taxatio| or old assessment (i.e., the |Taxatio| of 1291) at 10 marks or less; and(i) the priory of St Andrew, York, on account of its notorious poverty.Receiving exemption from one half of the levy, and paying thus only half a tenth, were:(a) the monasteries of Marton, St Oswald, Nostell, Bolton in Craven, Roche, Haltemprice, Egglestone, Coverham, Warter, Kirkham, St. Robert, Knaresborough, Selby, Kirkstall and Pontefract (in Yorkshire), Cockersand (in Lancashire) and Newstead, Welbeck, Worksop and Thurgarton (in Nottinghamshire) and all their goods, benefices and possessions;(b) the churches of Catton and Kirby Wiske, Arncliff (appropriated to University College Oxford), North Burton, Middleton in the Wolds, Hinderwell, Easington and Huggate, Aberford (appropriated to the royal college of the university of Oxford), South Dalton and Leven (all in Yorkshire);(c) the prebends of East Stoke (Stoke by Newark) and North Scarle in the cathedral church of Lincoln, and Edingley, appurtenant to Southwell Minster, and Saltmarsh in the collegiate church of Howden;(d) the temporalities of the provostry of the collegiate church of Beverley and the parish church of Welwick (in Yorkshire), which is annexed to the said provostry, and the church of Patrington, \'on account of the storms of the sea and the Humber and the diminution of their fruits and provents\' (|CFR 1485-1509|, p 75); (e) the churches of Preston in Holderness (appropriated to the subdeanery of York Minster), Welton and Nunburnholme (in Yorkshire); and(f) the prebends of South Muskham in Southwell Minster, and Wetwang in York Minster, the latter on account of its excessive assessment.Receiving an exemption from payment of two-thirds of the tenth, and paying thus only a third of a tenth, was the prebend of Langtoft in York Minster, and receiving an exemption from three-quarters of the tenth, and paying thus only a quarter of a tenth, was the provostry of the collegiate church of St. Mary, Hemingbrough (in Yorkshire).Commissions for collection were issued on 10 September 1487, and the names of the collectors were to be certified to the Exchequer by 3 November 1487.

865,1489 Feb 27 ,"clerical subsidy of £25,000, Canterbury province ",Henry VII ,"In response to a royal writ of 19 November 1488, the clergy of the province of Canterbury were summoned to a convocation at St. Paul\'s, London, on 14 January 1489.  The archbishop\'s record of this convocation is unusually full.  On 19 January, John Lord Dinham, Treasurer of England, John, earl of Oxford, Thomas, earl of Derby and other members of the king\'s council entered the chapter house of St. Paul\'s, where the clergy were meeting.  Lord Dinham made a speech thanking the clergy, on the king\'s behalf, for their charity and the concern that they had shown to the king.  He asked for their perseverence and promised to defend the rights and liberties of the church in England.  He then announced that the king, \'partly because of the request of the community of the realm expressed in the present parliament, partly and more especially to counter the threat posed to the realm by the king of France, was anxious to defend the realm, and in this enterprise he needed the succour of the prelates and clergy of the province, not only their prayers, but also their financial aid.\'  The archbishop replied that he would confer with convocation, and adjourned proceedings to the following day.The matter was apparently discussed on 20-23 January, but on 23 January the session was prorogued until 30 January.  On that day, Lord Dinham, the earls of Oxford and Derby and other king\'s councillors paid a second visit.  Lord Dinham announced that Henry VII had heard that the king of France was preparing an army for \'an invasion and final conquest of England\' and desired that they grant him a subsidy without delay.  No grant was yet forthcoming, however, as the clergy undoubtedly waited to see what the laity would grant, and the session was adjourned until 4 February.  A series of further adjournments followed, and at last, on 27 February, four days after parliament granted the king a subsidy of £75,000, the elected speaker of the lower house of convocation announced to the archbishop the clergy\'s grant of a subsidy of £25,000, to which the archbishop gave his consent (|The Register of John Morton, Archbishop of Canterbury 1486-1500|, ed. C Harper-Bill, (Canterbury and York Society, LXXV, 1987), I, pp 30-32).It had been determined that an overall sum of £100,000 was required by the king, with the southern clergy expected to supply £25,000 of it.  Since one tenth yielded only about £15,200, this amount fell somewhat short of what was required.  The clergy granted, therefore, a subsidy of two tenths of all ecclesiastical goods, benefices and possessions, assessed and accustomed to pay the tenth, two tenths of the goods, benefices and possessions not assessed and two tenths of the goods, benefices and possessions of the alien priories, but with the proviso that when a total of £25,000 had been paid, the prelates and clergy would be acquitted and exonerated from any further payment.  The tax was to be paid in two equal instalments, each totalling £12,500, which was apportioned among the eighteen dioceses of the province and the jurisdiction of St. Albans, on a pro-rata basis, evidently in accordance with the assessment of the |Taxatio| of 1291.  A schedule of the total contributions (or quotas) to be made by each diocese was included in the text of the grant recorded in the archbishop\'s register (and in the commissions for collection issued by the king) and the collectors appointed in each diocese must have been given schedules of the further division of these quotas within the archdeaconries, benefices etc., all apparently based upon an adjusted form of the |Taxatio|.  The sub-divided quotas for the diocese of Canterbury, for example, are copied into the archbishop\'s register.Additional conditions attached to the grant were: (a) that if any collector was not able to collect the sum due from any person, and he signified to the Exchequer the name of the defaulter and sum due, then the collector, and the prelates and clergy of the province, were to be exonerated for this sum, and it would be left to the Exchequer to proceed against the defaulter, and the certificate of the collector or his attorney was to be accepted on this matter without further inquisition or delay; (b) that if it happened that the war with France lasted for another year or two years, so that there was need of the same expenditure by the clergy for defence, then the clergy of the province granted the king a similar subsidy for each of the two years, on the same terms (corresponding to the grant made by the laity in parliament).  If, as time passed, it became obvious that such enormous expense was not needed for defence for either of these years, then convocation mandated that the subsidy would be reduced as circumstances allowed, but the prelates and clergy granted the king such a lesser subsidy for each of the next two years, in the same proportion to the sum granted by the commons in parliament, as was the present £25,000; and (c) that this grant was not to be taken as a precedent, as it was unprecedented, because in former times the province of Canterbury had acknowledged and borne such burdens only in times of urgent necessity.Excused wholly from payment were:(a) the ecclesiastical goods, possessions and benefices of all colleges or collegiate halls in the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, Eton College (in Buckinghamshire), Winchester College (in Winchester), Syon Abbey (in Middlesex), and all Carthusian houses in the province; and(b) all monasteries, colleges, churches and other pious places which the diocesan considered ought to be exempt and whose name he signified to the Exchequer, which certificate was to be accepted without delay or further inquisition.The low number of exemptions granted to religious houses was the result of an attempt to do away with blanket exemptions.  An act of parliament passed in the same year revoked all previous royal exemptions with the exception of a variety of privileges extended to a few religious houses (|Stat. Realm|, II, pp 530-532).Commissions for collection of the tax were issued on 28 February 1489.  The bishops of each diocese were to certify the Exchequer of the names of the collectors of both moieties of the tax within their diocese by 15 March (for the first moiety) and 15 September (for the second), and if there was a further division between the collectors, the total sum to be collected by each individual collector is also to be certified to the Exchequer.  For the original file of certificates returned to the Exchequer from each diocese and the jurisdiction of St. Albans, see E 179/67/52.  The first moiety was to be collected on 25 March and paid to the king by 1 May, and the second moiety was to be collected on 29 September and paid to the king by 1 November.Each collector was empowered by convocation to punish and coerce any defaulters, by means of suspension, excommunication, interdict and sequestration, until full payment was made, with reimbursement of any expenses incurred.  Once such payment was made, the collector could grant absolution and relax any process arising from the matter.  Each collector was also entitled to remuneration of 2 groats for every pound collected.(|The Register of John Morton, Archbishop of Canterbury 1486-1500|, ed.

866,1489 March 18 or earlier ,two clerical tenths from York province ,Henry VII ,"In response to a royal writ of 19 November 1488, the clergy of the northern province were convoked in a provincial council at York on 27 January 1489.  In the sessions held on the following days, the clergy were exhorted \'with all diligence\' first by the archbishop\'s commissaries, William, abbot of St. Mary\'s, York, William Shefeld, treasurer of York Minster, and William Poteman, archdeacon of the East Riding, and later by the archbishop in person, to make the king a grant of a subsidy \'larger than usual, in relief of his more grievous burdens\'.

In the days following, they were exhorted by the archbishop\'s commissaries William, bishop of Carlisle, William Sheffeld, dean of York, and Hugh Trotter, treasurer of York Minster, to make a grant of a subsidy to the king.  After many discussions, they unanimously granted him a tenth of all ecclesiastical goods, benefices and possessions, \'on account of the great and unusually urgent necessities and causes, which newly arising, concern the preservation and defence of the English church and the governance and tranquillity of the realm of England\' (|CFR 1485-1509|, p 237).  How long their session lasted is not known, but the grant had certainly been made by 31 May 1496, when the king was notified of it.The conditions attached to the grant were: (a) that it would be nullified, if any prelates or clergy who held possessions or benefices in the outlying parts of Cumberland, Westmorland, Northumberland or Copeland (in Cumberland) were compelled, by the king or archbishop, or any other person by any authority, to resist in person the Scots or other enemies of the realm, or to ward off any invasion of the same, or at their own charges and expenses to find armed men for such purpose; (b) that if any collector was unable to collect the sum due from any person, and he signified to the Exchequer the name of the defaulter and sum due, then the collector, and the prelates and clergy of the province, would be exonerated for this sum, and it would be left to the Exchequer to proceed against the defaulter, and the certificate of the collector or his attorney was to be accepted on this matter without further inquisition or delay; (c) that every collector appointed by the ordinary to collect the tenth or any part of it, when rendering his account at the Exchequer, shall have for the labours and expenses of himself and his servants 8d. from every pound of money which he has collected (i.e., 20s.), and all collectors shall deem themselves satisfied with such remuneration without seeking further reward in this behalf;

The tax was to be paid in two instalments, of £20,000 each, which was apportioned among the eighteen dioceses of the province and the jurisdiction of St. Albans (included in the apportionment for Lincoln diocese), on a pro-rata basis (see PRO, E 371/262, rot. 59 for the apportionments).  The appointments of the collectors, made by the bishops in each diocese, would have included schedules of the further division of these quotas within the archdeaconries, benefices etc., apparently based upon an adjusted form of the |Taxatio| of 1291. As in 1489, it was probably left to the bishops or ordinaries to grant exemptions where appropriate, and to certify the Exchequer of those excused. In the event of defaulters, collectors were to certify the Exchequer after 40 days of their inability to collect the sums, and were then to be acquitted and exonerated of these amounts in their accounts, their oaths on the matter to be accepted without further delay or inquisition.Commissions for collection were issued on 15 March 1497, and the names of the collectors of the first moiety were to be certified to the Exchequer by 20 May. The first moiety was to be collected on 1 May and paid into the Exchequer by 1 June 1497. The names of the collectors of the second moiety were to be certified to the Exchequer by 20 October and the tax was to be collected on 1 November and paid into the Exchequer by 21 November 1497.The collection of the tax may have been disrupted by the rebellion in Cornwall, and most of the evidence of its levy among the E 179 documents relates to the first moiety. For example, E 179/9/71A is the certificate sent to the Exchequer by the archbishop of Canterbury, dated 13 April 1497, of the appointment of the abbot and convent of Boxley as collectors of the first moiety of the tax in the diocese; they were to collect half of the £2,742 apportioned to the diocese, and like certificates survive from the dioceses of Chichester (E 179/12/146a-b), London ( E 179/43/264) Lincoln (E 179/39/775) and Norwich (E 179/46/204). E 179/33/17b is a similar certificate from the bishop of Llandaff, notifying the Exchequer of the appointment in his diocese of the abbot and convent of Tintern for the same moiety, on 5 May 1497.  A total of £270 was to be contributed by the clergy of Llandaff, and the collectors were responsible to the Exchequer for half that amount, as is clearly stated in the certificate. Receipts of the first moiety were entered into a collection book listing receipts at the Exchequer in 1497-8 (PRO, E 405/477, ff. 21-33).Henry VII was reportedly forced to remit payment of £10,000 of this subsidy.

878,1502 April 11 x May 18 ,"clerical subsidy of £12,542 from Canterbury province ",Henry VII ,"Following a series of attacks launched against Venetian territories by the Turks, Pope Alexander VI decided to revive the project of a universal crusade.  In 1500 he called on the nations of the Christian world to unite against the Turks, and made known his intention to impose a subsidy of one tenth of all ecclesiastical income in order to finance the project.  Although Henry VII was more favourably disposed towards the idea of a crusade than most of the other monarchs of Christendom, he was opposed to the imposition of a tenth by papal mandate to be levied by a foreign papal legate, which he saw as an infringement of his liberties and a dangerous precedent.  Instead, the king persuaded the pope that he would ask the English clergy for a grant of a subsidy, which he would levy on the pope\'s behalf.  He requested further that all future convocations of the English clergy be called in his name and by his authority alone, in order to exclude the papal claim to levy tenths in England by papal bull.In response to the king\'s writ of 4 December 1501, the clergy of the southern province were summoned to a convocation at St. Paul\'s, London, on 1 February 1502.  On 14 February the session was prorogued, due to absenteeism, until 11 April.  In the next session, which lasted until 18 May 1502, they granted the king a subsidy of £12,000 in aid of the Christian religion against the Turks, and an additional sum of £542 to pay the cost of collecting the subsidy.  The tax was to be levied according to the method of a tenth, from all ecclesiastical goods, benefices, possessions, pensions and portions, whether assessed or unassessed to pay the tenth, from chantries worth £10 yearly or more, and from alien priories, whether in lay or clerical hands.  Although it was to be levied in the manner of a tenth, and, indeed, at least one collector, Thomas, abbot of Abingdon, collector in the archdeaconry of Berkshire, referred to it as a tenth (Westminster Abbey Muniments 5774), the normal yield of a tenth was £18,500 - more than the total amount to be collected.  The total sum of £12,542 was apportioned, therefore, among the dioceses, in accordance with the proportions paid by each in the levy of a tenth, a schedule of which was copied into the record of convocation.  The grant was made on condition that: (a) no one was to pay more than he/she was accustomed to pay for a tenth; (b) that no persons present in the lower house of the convocation in which the tax was granted, whether in their own names or as proctors, will be appointed to collect it; and (c) that every collector appointed to collect the tax, or any part of it, were to receive 8d. from every pound collected, for the labours and expenses of himself and his servants.  Collectors were given the power, moreover, to compel payment by ecclesiastical censures and by sequestration.  Excused wholly from payment were:(a) all ecclesiastical benefices that, on account of their poverty, are unofficed, to be certified by the relevant bishop or ordinary;(b) the ecclesiastical goods, possessions and benefices of all colleges or collegiate halls in the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, Eton College (in Buckinghamshire), and Winchester College (in Winchester);(c) the goods, benefices and possessions of Syon Abbey (in Middlesex), the priory of Sheen (in Surrey), the London Charterhouse and all other Carthusian houses in the province;(d) the ecclesiastical goods, benefices and possessions of the house of London Minoresses (or the nuns of St. Clare without Aldgate), the abbey of Rewley (Oxfordshire) and the priory of Barnwell (Cambridgeshire).Exempt from one half of the levy were the ecclesiastical goods, benefices and possessions of the order of St. John of Jerusalem (or the Hospitallers) and the collegiate church of St. George, Windsor.Commissions for collection were issued on 21 June 1502, and the collectors were to be appointed by the diocesans for the levy of the first moiety by 23 September 1502, and for the second moiety by 7 April 1503.  The first half of the tax was to be collected on 29 September and paid to the receivers by 11 November 1502, and the second half was to be collected on 16 April 1503 and paid to the receivers by 4 June 1503.  The tax money was to be received, not at the Exchequer, but by the archbishop of Canterbury and bishop of Winchester, who were to be instructed by the king regarding its disposal.  By December 1503, William Lichfield, the London commissary of these two prelates, had transferred £11,900 of the money collected to the king\'s chamber (PRO, E 101/413/2/3, ff. 85, 113, 167).Henry VII does not appear to have kept any of the proceeds of the subsidy for himself.  On 27 May 1502 he announced that he intended to contribute money to the king of Hungary for use against the Turks, and on 20 June 1502, his ambassadors gave an undertaking to Maxmilian, the Holy Roman Emperor, that he would pay him £10,000 for his efforts in resisting the Turks (PRO, E 30/691).  Maximilian acknowledged receipt of this sum on 28 July 1502, and another £4,000 was forwarded to the pope in the same year.  Although technically granted to the king, this was really a papal subsidy, and at least one collector (the collector in the archdeaconry of Berkshire), referred to it as such.(Wilkins, |Concilia|, III, p 646; |Lunt, |Financial Relations of the Papacy with England 1327-1534|, pp 156-160; |The Registers of Oliver King, Bishop of Bath and Wells 1496-1503 and Hadrian de Castello, Bishop of Bath and Wells 1503-1518|, ed.

This assembly was subsequently prorogued, however, until 15 October.  On that day, the northern clergy again met and voted the king a subsidy of a tenth for defence against the Turks, to be levied on all ecclesiastical goods, benefices and possessions, assessed and accustomed to pay a tenth.The conditions attached to the grant were: (a) that if any collector was unable to collect the sum due from any person, and he signified to the archbishop the name of the defaulter and sum due, then the collector would be exonerated for this sum, and the certificate of the collector or his attorney was to be accepted on this matter; and (b) that every collector appointed by the ordinary to collect the tenth or any part of it, when rendering his account, shall have for the labours and expenses of himself and his servants 8d. from every pound of money which he has collected (i.e., 20s.).

Wholly excused from payment of these tenths were:(a) all benefices, curacies, dignities, prebends, hospitals, pensions and portions assessed by the |Nova Taxatio| or old assessment (i.e., the |Taxatio| of 1291) at 10 marks or less;(b) all ecclesiastical benefices within the province appropriated to colleges, halls and houses of the universities of Cambridge and Oxford, or any religious houses appropriated to the use of scholars of those universities;(c) all benefices and possessions of the priory of Watton (in Yorkshire), because of the great number of nuns;(d) all monasteries of all nuns and their goods, benefices and possessions, because of their notorious poverty;(e) the temporalities and the hospital of St. Leonard, York, because of the great diminution of its provents and the costly maintenance of indigent paupers there;(f) the possessions and ecclesiastical benefices of Carthusian monks living in the province, with pensions or portions in the province assessed at £5 per annum or less;(g) the commons of the chapel of St. Mary and the Holy Angels (a chapel adjoining the north side of the nave of York Minster, also known as St. Sepulchre\'s), York, and of the collegiate church of St. John of Beverley and the temporalities and provostry of St. John of Beverley, because of the great devastation of its lands and possessions by waters of the sea and the Humber;(h) the prebend of Skipwith in the collegiate church of Howden, because the great consumption of its provents by the flooding of the water of the Derwent;(i) the prebends of North Clifton in Lincoln cathedral, in the church of Beverley, and Osbaldwick in York Minster, because of the diminution of the fruits of their benefices;(j) the ecclesiastical possessions, spiritualities and temporalities of the monasteries of Egglestone, Ellerton, St. Andrew, York, Drax, Ferriby and Holy Trinity, York (in Yorkshire), and Mattersay (in Nottinghamshire);(k) the temporalities and monastery (or hospital) of Easby, |alias| St. Agatha\'s (in Yorkshire), because of its notorious poverty and the diminution of its fruits and provents;(l) the ecclesiastical goods, benefices and possessions of the priory of Malton (in Yorkshire), because of the speedy and costly construction and re-building of the nave of the conventual church and their other houses, because the old nave fell down;(m) the provostry of the collegiate church of St. Mary, Hemingbrough (in Yorkshire), and the churches of Heighington and Aycliffe (in Durham), because of the diminution of their lands, provents and possessions because of the withdrawal of their lands from cultivation to pasture;(n) the churches of Bubwith, Ainderby Steeple and Aysgarth (in Yorkshire), and Walkeringham, Barnby in the Willows and Barton in Fabis (in Nottinghamshire), because of unusual flooding this year;(o) the church of Stillingfleet, the hospital  of St. Mary, Bootham (in Yorkshire), the churches of St. Mary, Nottingham, South Collingham, the hospital of Sibthorp (all in Nottinghamshire), and the churches of Sigglesthorne and Lofthouse, the vicarage of Kirkby Moorside and the church of Sproatley (all in Yorkshire), because of the great diminution of their provents;(p) the church of Kneesall (in Nottinghamshire), appropriated to the use of the vicars choral of Southwell Minster;(q) the church of Ferry Fryston (in Yorkshire), appropriated to the vicars choral of York Minster;(r) the church of \'Croft\' in the archdeaconry of Richmond, because the archdeacon of Richmond receives the whole fruit of it, and the rector receives nothing for it this year, and because of the great diminution of its fruits and provents;(s) the churches of Flintham and Whatton (in Nottinghamshire), appropriated to the abbey of Welbeck, because of the abbey\'s great debts and burden of hospitality;(t) the churches of Adlingfleet in Marshland and Welwick in Holderness (both in Yorkshire), because of the great diminution of its lands and provents, due to terrible floods of the waters of the sea and the Humber, Ouse and Trent rivers, and the costly maintenance of the banks of the said rivers; (u) the portions of Charles de Bello[?] and Roger Burde, portioners in the church of St. John, Beverley, and totally destroyed, so that it is wholly unknown to whom they are collated; and(v) all benefices and spiritual and temporal possessions within the diocese of Carlisle and in Copeland, within the archdeaconry of Northumberland, which have been assessed in the |Nova Taxatio|, as well as those which have not been assessed.Excused from a moiety of the tenth, and paying, thus, half a tenth, were:(a) the ecclesiastical benefices and spiritual and temporal possessions of the monasteries of Roche, Monkbretton, Helagh Park and St. Robert, Knaresborough (in Yorkshire) and Rufford and Blyth (in Nottinghamshire), because of notorious poverty and the diminution of their fruits and provents; Pontefract (in Yorkshire), because of the heavy burden of building and repairing of the same; Kirkstall and Bridlington (in Yorkshire), because of the great diminution of their lands and possessions in Holderness, by the waters of the sea and the Humber, and the costly maintenance of the river banks;(b) the temporalities of the priory of Thurgarton (in Nottinghamshire), and the prebends of Driffield and East Stoke in Lincoln cathedral;(c) the churches of Huggate, Londsborough, Rowley, Middleton on the Wolds, North Burton and Slaidburn (all in Yorkshire), because of the great diminution of their fruits and their excessive assessment;(d) the churches of Finningley (in Nottinghamshire), and Brandesburton, Halsham, Hinderwell, Easington, Kirkby Wiske, Danby Wiske, Leven, Patrington, and the vicarage of Withernsea (all in Yorkshire), because of the diminution of their lands and provents through the flooding of the waters of the sea, the Humber and other rivers;(e) the priory of Coverham, and the churches of Coverham, Sedbergh and Kettlewell (all in Yorkshire), appropriated to the priory, because of their notorious poverty and the paucity of their fruits and provents;(f) the churches of Tankersley, North Otterington, Little Sandal, Thweng, Bolton Percy, Roos, Kirkby (in Cleveland), Rither and Harewood (all in Yorkshire), because of the diminution of their fruits and provents by the withdrawal of their lands from cultivation to parks and pasture;(g) the prebend of Saltmarsh in the collegiate church of Howden and the church of Welton, because of the poverty and diminution of their lands; (h) the churches of \'Bramworth\' and Arksey (in Yorkshire); and(i) all benefices, pensions and portions within the archdeaconry of Durham assessed at £20 per annum or less, the deanery of Auckland, and the parish church of Haughton-le-Skerne (in Durham).Excused from one-third of the tax, and paying, thus, two-thirds of a tenth, were:(a) the goods, benefices and possessions of the monastery of Haltemprice (in Yorkshire), because of the great diminution of its lands and possessions in Holderness, through flooding of the waters of the sea and the Humber, and the costly maintenance of its banks;(b) the goods, benefices and possessions of the monasteries of Bolton in Craven and Kirkham (in Yorkshire), and Worksop and Shelford (in Nottinghamshire), because of their continuing and frequent burden of hospitality and the great diminution of their fruits and provents;(c) the goods, benefices and possessions of the abbey of Whitby, because its great debts and the ruin of its buildings; and(d) the goods, benefices and possessions of the priory of Warter, because of its notorious poverty.The ecclesiastical benefices and spiritual and temporal possessions of the abbey of Meaux (in Yorkshire) were granted an exemption wholly from payment of the tax, because these had been destroyed in great part by the waters of the sea and Humber, as appeared by divers inquisitions made by royal precept, shown to convocation, but nevertheless, with the agreement of the abbot, it was decided that the abbey would pay the £8 4s.9 1/2d. which they are accustomed to pay for a tenth, for their goods etc. not consumed or destroyed, because the money was intended for a pious use and salubrious expedition.All those refusing or delaying payment of the tenths would be put under ecclesiastical censures, that is, be suspended, excommunicated or put under indict, and the fruits of their benefices sequestrated and sold until the collector or collectors were fully satisfied of the amount owed.Commissions for collection were issued by the archbishop on 1 February 1503.  The first half of the tax was to be collected on 16 April 1503 and paid to the archbishop of York by 24 June 1503.  The second half was to be collected on 11 November 1503 and paid to the archbishop by 7 April 1504.  The tax money was to be received, not at the Exchequer, but by the archbishop of York, who was to be instructed by the king regarding its disposal.  The collectors were to render account before the archbishop in the chapter house of York Minster and the acquittances which he gave to them were to be sufficient to discharge them.  Because it was administered outside the royal Exchequer, there is little evidence of the levy in Exchequer records.Henry VII does not appear to have kept any of the proceeds of the subsidy for himself.  On 27 May 1502 he announced that he intended to contribute money to the king of Hungary for use against the Turks, and on 20 June 1502, his ambassadors gave an undertaking to Maxmilian, the Holy Roman Emperor, that he would pay him £10,000 for his efforts in resisting the Turks (PRO, E 30/691).

Exempt wholly from payment of the tenth were all ecclesiastical benefices within the archdeaconry of Northumberland which were assessed by the |Nova Taxatio|), as well as those benefices which were not.All temporalities within the archdeaconry of Northumberland which were assessed by the |Novo Taxatio| were also wholly exempt, except for the sum of 100s., which was to be paid for the tenth, and was apportioned among the following thus: from the abbot of Newminster 26s.8d.; from the abbot of Alnwick 13s.4d.; from the prior of Tynemouth 20s.; from the prior of Brinkburn 13s.4d.; from the master of the hospital of Sherburn 20s.; and from the master of the hospital of Gateshead 6s.8d.All ecclesiastical benefices and spiritual and temporal possessions within the diocese of Carlisle were also wholly exempt, but convocation mandated that they nevertheless be charged with the sum of £4 3s.10d., to be levied and collected at the discretion of the bishop of Carlisle.All collectors were to be appointed by the bishops or ordinaries, and in the case of anyone bound to pay the tenth who refused or delayed payment, upon 14 days\' warning having been given to the person either by writing or by posting notice on the doors of their churches or residences, the collectors had the power by authority of convocation to compel the defaulter by ecclesiastical censures, that is, by sentences of suspension, excommunication or interdict, or by other lawful remedies.  Upon the receipt of full payment, the collectors could release him from any sentence, censure or pain promulgated against him for this reason, provided that the delinquent payer first reimburse the collector for all expenses incurred by the collector on account of the delay, and revoke any process made by the collector against the defaulter.Commissions for collection were issued on 28 March 1505, and the names of the collectors were to be certified to the Exchequer by 2 May 1505.  The tax was to be paid in two instalments.  The first moiety was to be collected on 23 March 1505 and paid into the Exchequer by 24 June 1505, and the second moiety was to be collected on 25 December 1505 and paid into the Exchequer by 12 April 1506.  There do not appear to be any enrolled accounts of the receipts at the Exchequer.Accounts and correspondence of the collector of tenths in the diocese of Durham, for the years 1504-19 survive among documents formerly in the archive of Durham Cathedral Priory, now Durham University Library, Archives and Special Collections, Dean and Chapter, Locelli XVIII-XIX.(Wilkins, |Concilia|, III, p 649; |CFR 1485-1509|, pp 362-366; A K McHardy, \'Clerical Taxation in Fifteenth-Century England: The Clergy as Agents of the Crown\', in |The Church, Politics and Patronage in the Fifteenth Century|, ed.

882,1504 May 18 ,"clerical subsidy of £12,542 from Canterbury province ",Henry VII ,"The clergy of the southern province were summoned to a convocation at St. Paul\'s, London, which began on 16 February 1504, and lasted until 18 May 1504.  Before dissolving they granted the king a subsidy of £12,000 plus £542 for the costs of levying the subsidy.  It was to be levied, as in 1502, as a tenth of all ecclesiastical goods, benefices and possessions, assessed and accustomed to pay a tenth, as well as those not assessed to pay a tenth, and the goods, etc. of all alien priories.The tax was to be levied according to the method of a tenth, from all ecclesiastical goods, benefices, possessions, pensions and portions, whether assessed or unassessed to pay the tenth, from chantries worth £10 yearly or more, and from alien priories, whether in lay or clerical hands.  The total sum of £12,542 was apportioned, therefore, among the dioceses, in accordance with the proportions paid by each in the levy of a tenth, a schedule of which was copied into the record of convocation, and despatched with the commissions to the diocesans.  A copy of the apportionment among the dioceses of the province (and jurisdiction of St. Albans) survives in the register of Richard Mayew, bishop of Hereford (f 20v).  The grant was made on condition that: (a) no one was to pay more than he/she was accustomed to pay for a tenth; (b) that no persons present in the lower house of the convocation in which the tax was granted, whether in their own names or as proctors, would be appointed to collect it; and (c) that every collector appointed to collect the tax, or any part of it, was to receive 8d. from every pound collected, for the labours and expenses of himself and his servants.  Collectors were given the authority to sequester estates and appropriate benefices in the event of failure or refusal to pay 30 days after written warnings.  They were not to be charged in their accounting with payments deemed uncollectable, after proper certification of defaulters.Excused wholly from payment were:(a) all ecclesiastical benefices that, on account of their poverty, are unofficed, to be certified by the relevant bishop or ordinary;(b) the ecclesiastical goods, possessions and benefices of all colleges or collegiate halls in the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, Eton College (in Buckinghamshire), and Winchester College (in Winchester);(c) the goods, benefices and possessions of Syon Abbey (in Middlesex), the priory of Sheen (in Surrey), the London Charterhouse and all other Carthusian houses in the province;(d) the ecclesiastical goods, benefices and possessions of the house of London Minoresses (or the nuns of St. Clare without Aldgate), the abbey of Rewley (Oxfordshire) and the priory of Barnwell (Cambridgeshire).The tax was to be collected in two equal instalments, and commissions to collect the first moiety were issued on 24 May 1504, and the second moiety on 8 February 1505.  Sub-collectors were to be deputed to collect the first moiety by 1 September 1504 and the second moiety by 1 March 1505, and their names certified to the two receivers of the tax by those dates.  The receipts were to be paid not to the Exchequer but to the two appointed receivers, the archbishop of Canterbury and the bishop of Winchester, in the chapter house of St. Paul\'s.  The first moiety was to be collected on 29 September 1504 and paid to the receivers by 30 November 1504, and the second moiety was to be collected on 23 March 1505 and paid to the receivers by 24 June 1505.There are no known records relating to the levy of this tax, and no enrolled accounts survive.(Wilkins, |Concilia|, III, p 647; Herefordshire Record Office, Registers of the Bishops of Hereford, Register of Richard Mayew, ff. 20-23; M.

(e) that every collector appointed by the ordinary to collect the tenth or any part of it, when rendering his account at the Exchequer, shall have for the labours and expenses of himself and his servants 8d. from every pound of money which he has collected, and all collectors shall deem themselves satisfied with such remuneration without seeking further reward in this behalf; (f) that, when accounting, no collector shall be vexed or burdened by any clerks or ministers of the Exchequer, or by any other person there, by colour of any writ or suit or fee or any other demand of money, but that after rendering account all collectors shall immediately be freely dismissed without having to make any payment or promise of money, otherwise the grant of the tenth shall be held to be null and neither due nor payable;

237,1512 Nov 4 x Dec 20 ,subsidy ,Henry VIII ,"The second session of the parliament which began on 4 February 1512 opened on 4 November 1512.  In addition to a fifteenth and tenth, the commons granted what it termed a \'subsidy of poll tax\' before parliament was again prorogued on 20 December 1512.  This tax was in fact a carefully graduated poll tax on all those aged over 15, except for married women and beggars, who were exempt from all categories of assessment, as were members of the clergy, the universities and the colleges of Eton and Winchester.  Lords and knights were assessed according to their rank.  Dukes had to pay £6.13s.4d., marquesses and earls were assessed at £4, barons and baronets paid 40s., and knights, who were not lords of parliament, 30s.  All other liable persons were assessed according to their wealth.  For the first time, each person was to be assessed only in one category of wealth - whether for their lands (and/or other income), or their goods - whichever yielded the most profit to the crown.  This principle of assessment was to become standard for all Tudor and Stuart subsidies.Landholders, whether their tenure was freehold, copyhold or ancient demesne, or their estate was held to their use by others, and those in receipt of fees, offices, annuities or corrodies were assessed on the following scale:£40 or more  -  20s.£20-40          -  10s.£10-20          -    5s.40s.-£10       -    2s.under 40s.     -    1s.Those possessing goods and chattels were assessed as follows:£800 or more  -  53s.4d.£400-800        -  40s.£200-400        -  26s.8d.£100-200        -  13s.4d.£40-100          -   6s.8d.£20-40            -   3s.4d.£10-20            -   1s.8d.40s.-£10          -  1s.Wage earners were also for the first time since 1450 held liable to pay the subsidy.  \'Labourers, journeymen, artificers, handicraftmen and servants\', both male and female, over the age of 15 years, earning wages or other profits of 40s. per annum or more, were expected to pay a poll tax of 4d.  Aliens were assessed on the same scales, but at double the rate.In its administration, this tax was highly innovative, establishing the procedure which was to become standard for the levy of all Tudor and Stuart subsidies.  A two-tiered arrangement, for local execution and county-wide supervision, was put in place for both assessment and collection.  Increased in number to an average of 35 per county, the commissioners appointed by parliament (whose names are printed in the statute) were to divide themselves into smaller units, and send precepts to the constables and other local officers for the assessment of local inhabitants in writing, which the commissioners could amend, if necessary, after examination of the assessors or taxpayers.  Finalised assessments in triplicate were to be written after this process was completed, one copy of which was to be delivered to the high collectors, and another of which was to be given to the knights of the shire and burgesses to bring with them to the next parliament.  The assessment of the households of the king and queen were to be made separately by leading officers in those households.  The assessment process was to be completed by 10 April 1513.The commissioners were to choose local or \'petty\' collectors from among local officers and substantial local inhabitants, and give them a list of the sums to be collected from each person within their parish or township.  They were also to appoint \'certain sufficient and able persons\' to be high collectors at the hundred or wapentake level, who were to be given lists of the petty collectors and the sums for which they were responsible.  It was the responsibility of the high collectors, then, to collect the money from the petty collectors and convey it to the Exchequer.  Payment was to be made by 1 July 1513.Although it is not mentioned in the statute, the commons granted the king a total sum of £120,000, and the subsidy was evidently expected to yield this amount.  It fell far short, bringing in a net sum of £32,557.According to Hoyle, assessments for this tax were not delivered to the Exchequer. However, an assessment for Seisdon hundred, Staffs., survives at E 179/177/147, as does a communal assessment for Holderness wapentake in the East Riding of Yorkshire at E 179/202/159; it may be that these were brought to the Exchequer by the collectors when they came to render account, although the endorsment to the Staffordshire document suggests that it was certified to the Exchequer as were the 1524 returns.(|Stat.

238,1514 Jan 23 x March 4 ,"subsidy of £160,000 ",Henry VIII ,"Parliament opened for a third session on 23 January 1514.  Between that date and 4 March 1514, when it was adjourned, the commons granted a subsidy of £160,000 (or more, if more was raised).  The form in which the tax was to be levied was again a graduated poll tax.A rate of 6d. per pound was to be charged on the value of income from lands and offices of those possessing estates of 20s. or more per annum, and on the capital value of goods of those with goods worth 40s. or more.  Wage earners were subject to a graduated scale: those earning 40s. per annum or more had to pay 12d., those with wages of 20s.-40s. paid 6d., and servants and apprentices earning below 20s. paid only 4d.  Aliens were charged double these rates, and all aliens over the age of 15 without lands, goods or chattels, or wages were to pay a poll tax of 8d.  Married women, beggars and children under 15 were again exempt, as were the universities and the colleges of Eton and Winchester.The assessment and collection procedures were to be the same as in 1512, with assessment to be completed by Easter (16 April) 1514, and certification of assessment due at the Exchequer by 18 June.  Payment was to be received at the Exchequer on 25 June 1514.More parliamentary control over the levy of the subsidy was provided by the act, however, in the form of a commons committee to oversee its administration.  The committee was composed of the lord treasurer, the justices of the King\'s Bench and Common Pleas, the Speaker of the Commons, one knight from every shire, two burgesses from London and one burgess from each of the principal cities and boroughs.  The commissioners, appointed by parliament and named in the statute, were to send to this committee certificates bearing the names of the high collectors and the sums for which they were responsible, by 1 July.  The committee was given authority to fine defaulting commissioners, to appoint commissioners for areas for which none had been assigned and to determine all questions arising from the levy of the subsidy.  Having received notification of the amounts assessed, the committee was to calculate the expected yield of the subsidy, and were it to fall short of the required £160,000, they had the power to make estimates of additional rates to be levied that would make good the deficit.  A second subsidy, levied at these new rates, but according to the same procedure as before, would then be instituted.Payment of the subsidy was slow to be received.  An onus of account for the rape of Hastings in Sussex, for example, notes that the collectors\' tally for payment was raised on 15 October 1515, over a year after the sum was to have been paid into the Exchequer (E 179/189/112).  The great majority of the certificates of assessment (generally naming the petty collectors) and and communal assessments (giving the charges for each settlement) returned into the Exchequer are gathered into three files (E 179/279/1-3).  Another file (E 179/273/31) contains interim accounts for many counties.  Although it is generally believed that no nominal returns of taxpayers were made into the Exchequer for the levy of this tax, some have been found among the E 179 documents - for the hundred of Harlow in Essex (E 179/108/141), and the hundreds of Blackheath, Wotton, Kingston and Elmbridge in Surrey (E 179/184/131, 132). The net yield of the subsidy was just short of £50,000 (£49,671), but the committee evidently felt itself unable to levy another subsidy without a fresh parliamentary mandate.  Writs of summons to a new parliament were issued, therefore, on 23 November 1514.(|Stat.

239,1515 Feb 5 or later - Dec 22 or earlier ,two subsidies ,Henry VIII ,"Parliament opened on 5 February 1515.  Of the £160,000 granted to the king in 1514, only just over £50,000 (gross) had been received.  Therefore, by 5 April 1515, when parliament was prorogued, another £110,000 was granted, to be levied in the same form of graduated poll tax as the subsidies granted in 1512 and 1514.  Appointment of the commissioners was again made by parliament and is printed in the statute.  The assessment procedure was to be carried out as before, and was to be completed by 29 September 1515.  Certification of the amounts to be expected was to be received in the Exchequer by 15 October, and payment was due on 21 November.As before, a parliamentary committee was to oversee the administration of the subsidy and to be notified of the amounts that had been assessed.  In the event of another shortfall, the committee was this time given more precise instructions within the parliamentary act itself on how to proceed.  If the deficit was to be greater than £30,000, then a second subsidy identical to the first was to be levied in the following year to raise the difference.  Within eight days of the finalisation of the assessments, the committee was to certify Chancery to renew the commissions to the former commissioners for the levy of the second subsidy.  The assessment for this second subsidy was to be completed by 29 September 1516, and certification to the Exchequer was to be made by 19 October 1516.  Payment would be due on 21 November 1516.If the deficit was to be less than £30,000, then the shortfall would be divided up amongst the counties and boroughs at the discretion of the committee, within which the commissioners would apportion the required sums according to the value of goods and income from lands, fees, offices and wages assessed for the first subsidy, so that £1 value in each category of wealth carried an equal burden.  Payment of this tax would be due on 11 November 1517.Files of documents for the first subsidy, which yielded a gross sum of only £45,637 13s. 8d., survive at E 179/279/3 and E 179/237/71. The levy of the second subsidy, therefore, was to take place, but again, the committee was not deemed to have sufficient authority to order the levy, and a fresh parliamentary mandate was required.Parliament had been prorogued on 5 April until a second session commenced on 12 November 1515, in which it was confirmed that the second subsidy was to be levied, in the same manner in which the first subsidy had been.  As explained in the preamble to the subsidy act, only £45,637.13s.8d. of the £110,000 granted in the first session had been received, leaving a deficiency of £64,362.6s.4d.  To supply part of this deficit, a fifteenth and tenth was also granted (see below), which meant that this subsidy had to raise only c. £35,000.  Because the attainment of the original grant of £160,000 in 1514 was now to be realised, the control of the commissioners by a parliamentary committee was abandoned, and the Exchequer was left to oversee the administration of the tax.In fact, the second subsidy yielded a net amount of £44,435, although actual payment may have been slow to be received.  The account of the collectors for the rape of Lewes in Sussex, for example, was not audited until Hilary term 1521 (E 179/189/114) and that of the collectors for the hundred of Bosmere and Claydon in Suffolk, until Trinity term, 1524 (E 179/180/124).(|Stat.

241,1523 May 21 ,subsidy ,Henry VIII ,"Parliament opened on 15 April 1523.  On 21 May it granted an annual subsidy for four years, to be assessed each year between 29 September and 11 November, and paid the following 9 February.  It was hoped to raise a total sum of £800,000, although no mention of this amount was included in the text of the parliamentary act.For the first two years, land was assessed at 12d. in the pound, and moveable goods at the rate of 12d. in the pound for those with over £20 of goods, and 6d. in the pound for those with 40s.-£20 of goods.  Persons who were paid annual wages of over 20s. were charged with 4d. annually, although in practice many commissioners assessed such wage earners to pay 6d.  Aliens paid a double tax of 8d. on their wages, if they received any, and if they did not, they were required to pay a poll tax of 8d.  Henry VIII was in a hurry to obtain the money to fund campaigns in France and demanded that the wealthier taxpayers make loans, known as &#8216;anticipations&#8217;, of the first payment by 11 November 1523 (see E 179/108/147, for example).An original commission ordering the collection of the anticipation in Worcestershire, dated 2 November 1523, gives details of its levy.  Only those with £40 or more in lands or goods were to be obliged to pay in advance, and payment was to be made by 30 November.  The commissioners were to levy the anticipation according to an assessment recorded in a &#8216;book&#8217; originally annexed to the commission.  This assessment was that which had been used to levy the forced loan of the previous year, and which had originally been completed as part of the &#8216;military survey&#8217; of 1522.  The return of the commissioners stated, however, that those persons liable to pay the anticipation refused to be assessed &#8216;after the rate as they were at the time of the loan, but would be assessed according to the act of parliament of the subsidy&#8217;, and in accordance with a new assessment which would reflect the \'diminishment\' in their estates since the military survey had been made.  The commissioners for Worcestershire claimed to be unable to proceed, therefore, until the new assessment had been completed (E 34/1B).  A possible example of a collector\'s \'book\' for Suffolk is now at E 179/180/180, with a record of amounts actually paid in E 179/180/179, although there is no reference to a need for a revised assessment in that county.The last two payments taxed only the well-off.  In the third year, only land was assessed: persons in possession of lands worth over £50 per annum paid 12d. in the pound, and in the fourth year, only moveable goods were assessed, again at 12d. per pound for over £50 worth.  For both payments, aliens paid double.  As before, no one was to be assessed on both land and goods.The commissioners were to divide themselves after receiving their commission and make their assessments.  The commissions each year were to be delivered to them by 16 September: a certificate of assessment for the first collection in Winchester (E 179/173/174 m 5) states that the relevant commission was dated 20 August 1523.  The assessment and collection procedures were substantially the same as those first put in place in 1512.  For the first time, however, commissioners were required to return duplicates of the individual assessments into the Exchequer, with the certificates of assessment, and this practice was to become standard procedure for the levy of all Tudor and Stuart subsidies.  Other improvements to the administration of the subsidy included stricter control of the assessment of the nobility, which was put under the supervision of the lord chancellor and other senior royal officials instead of the commissioners, an eight-day grace period extended to defaulters before their distrained goods were sold, and provision for the exoneration of the collectors from sums deemed uncollectable because of the death or disappearance of defaulters.  Commissioners were also to return a second copy of the certificate of assessment, including details of the total sums raised, to the Treasurer of the King\'s Chamber (e.g. E 179/212/118, a certificate for the first collection in various parts of the North Riding of Yorkshire, which bears an endorsement recording its delivery to the Treasurer).Many county assessments of the first and second payments have been printed; for a  complete list of these, see Hoyle, |Tudor Taxation Records|, pp 62-67.The procedure for the levy of the first payment of the tax was subsequently modified, and its collection delayed as a result.  The Exchequer was unhappy with the original certificates and lists received from the counties, and therefore, on 26 February 1524, a signet letter was sent to all the commissioners informing them that mistakes had been made in the interpretation of the subsidy act and enclosing a \'memorial\' which gave more specific instructions for the assessment.  Although no copy of this document is known to have survived, Dr Sheail has discerned its contents from his examination of the extant returns.  In those cases where the amounts assessed were lower than those recorded in the military survey of 1522, the memorial probably asked for justification of the changes, and for more precise assessments.  It also clarified ambiguities in the subsidy act, as conflicting instructions had been given for the assessment of those persons taxed on £2 worth of moveable goods: one clause included them in the category of £2 - £19 (to be taxed at 6d in the pound) and another stated that the assessments of £2 were to be rated at 4d in the pound. As a result of this revision, clearly the first collection would now be late: a Gloucestershire assessment states that it was due on or about 8 July 1524 (E 179/113/193: cf. E 179/113/194, a similar document produced before the revision). Finally, the commissioners were almost certainly told that they had to submit very full lists of the taxpayers to the Exchequer, replacing the rather rudimentary lists (containing only the sum totals and collectors for each settlement) that had been sent for earlier subsidies, and for the first assessment of this collection.  As Hoyle has noted, this innovation probably marks the beginning of the detailed nominal returns which characterised Tudor subsidies.These further instructions met with a varied response.  In some counties which had already compiled and sent in their assessments, the lists were merely amended to address the points raised in the new directions, but in others the assessments were abandoned for fresh ones.  In Oxfordshire, for example, two sets of lists - compiled before and after the memorial - have survived, as have various returns for parts of the West Riding of Yorkshire (e.g. the returns for Osgoldcross wapentake, the original certificate and assessment at E 179/206/109 and the more detailed second return at E 179/206/122 (assessment) and 206/135 (certificate)).  The same is the case in Leicestershire, where the unexpectedly low assessments returned in January 1524 were held to be suspect, and where, as the revised returns of April and May 1524 state, there was &#8216;vehement suspicion&#8217; that the inhabitants had subtracted the money for the forced loans imposed by the king in the previous year from the assessment of the value of their estates (E 179/133/104-109, 117, 122).  In some counties, however, the commissioners still did not make full returns, and in others the rates continued to be misinterpreted.A list of the commissioners for the fourth payment of this tax is now at E 179/281/2. Moreover, a large book at E 179/281/4 not only records the names of the commissioners and collectors for each of the final three payments of the tax, as well as the amounts due for each collection, but also includes transcribed details from the assessments for the entire country for the third collection, complete with the names and assessments of the taxpayers. A book containing copies of various onera of account for this tax is at E 179/281/3.The total net yields for each payment of the subsidy, as calculated by Dr. Schofield, were: £72,306; £64,807; £5,667; £9,137.  The returns are analysed, albeit with numerous and fairly major errors and omissions, in J. Sheail, &#8216;The Regional Distribution of Wealth in England as Indicated by the 1524-5 Lay Subsidy Returns&#8217; (Unpubl., Ph.D., Univ. of London, 1968) now published as |The Regional Distribution of Wealth as indicated in the 1524/5 Subsidy Returns|, ed.

243,1534 Nov 3 x Dec 18 ,subsidy ,Henry VIII ,"The prorogued parliament re-opened on 3 November 1534, and by 18 December 1534 had granted a lay subsidy over and above the fifteenth and tenth granted at the same time (qv). For the first time, the king received a grant of a subsidy not specifically for the purposes of financing a military expedition.  Whether or not this grant formed a precedent of constitutional importance has long been debated by historians.  For a summary of and recent contribution to the debate, see Hoyle, \'Crown, Parliament and Taxation\', pp 1174-1196. The same rate of taxation was levied on lands and goods.  The minimum threshold of liability in annual value of lands or in goods was £20.  The rate was:  native born individuals were to pay 12d. per pound, while aliens and guilds, brotherhoods, fraternities and companies were to pay 2s. per pound, although, as before, the subsidy was payable in only one category (land or goods) - whichever yielded the most tax to the crown.  Exemptions from the tax were specifically made for English merchants resident in Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmorland and the Bishopric of Durham, and Queen Anne and Katherine, Queen Dowager, as well as for the Cinque Ports.This rate was applicable to the entire subsidy and payment was to be made in two equal instalments on 6 November in both 1535 and 1536 to the Treasurer of the King\'s Chamber, although an assessment made in Surrey cites the quindene of Hilary next following (25 January 1536) as the date on which the first payment was due (E 179/184/176).  The commissioners were no longer to be appointed by parliament, but by the king, and are therefore not listed in the subsidy act.  They were not obliged to serve as commissioners for both payments.  Commissions for the levy of the first payment were issued on 22 February 1535 (E 179/184/174, rot 20), and for the second payment on 8 August 1536 (E 179/238/148).  In both years, the commissioners were to have one certificate certified in the Exchequer by 13 October and one certificate delivered to the Treasurer of the King\'s Chamber, presumably together with any monies collected.Returns from Sussex for the second of the two payments indicate that the money was slow to come in, which is not surprising, in view of the social unrest which coincided with the levy of this tax.  In some counties, the levy of the second payment was purposely delayed.  The assessments of the rapes of Hastings and Pevensey are endorsed with return dates of 21 April and 12 May 1538, respectively (E 179/189/169, 170). In Northamptonshire the high collector for the hundreds of Fawsley, Guilsborough and Nobottle Grove was ordered to collect the subsidy from the petty-collector in June 1537 and deliver it to Westminster by the following 6 November (E 179/156/173).The levy of the subsidy yielded a net amount of £21,710 in 1535 and £23,440 in 1536.(|Stat.

On 8 May it granted a subsidy, payable over two years, and four fifteenths and tenths.  Commissioners were to receive their commissions by 6 August each year, after which they were to divide themselves into smaller, geographically-based groups.The rates of taxation were:  individuals possessing land worth over £20 annually were to pay 12d. per pound each year, and those with moveable goods worth over £20 annually were rated to pay 6d. per pound each year.  Aliens were charged double these rates, and if they had no assessable property had to pay a poll tax of 4d. per head.Precepts were to be issued to constables and other local representatives between 1 September and 20 October in both 1540 and 1541, and the sum assessed on each town or other unit was to be certified to the Exchequer by 16 November, together with the names of the high collectors appointed by the commissioners.  Payment was due by 6 February following.Although the \'Act of Union\' of England with Wales of 1536 (27 Henry VIII, c. 26) had specified that some areas of Wales should be \'gildable\' or taxable from 1 November in that year, Wales was specifically exempted from this subsidy.  Exemptions also covered Ireland, Calais, Jersey and Guernsey, among other places; however, this subsidy was the first which the inhabitants of the palatine county of Cheshire were liable to pay.The net yield of the first payment of the subsidy was £46,619, and the second totalled £48,274.(|Stat.

247,1543 Jan 22 x May 12 ,subsidy ,Henry VIII ,"Parliament sat between 22 January and 12 May 1543, and between those dates granted a subsidy payable over three years.The subsidy was to be paid according to a complicated sliding scale of rates.  For those individuals taxed on moveable goods, the minimum threshold of liability was set at 20s., with those in the lowest income bracket paying a total of 4d. per pound across the three payments.  This rate rose to 8d. per pound for those with goods worth between £5 and £10, and to 16d. per pound for those with goods worth between £10 and £20. Individuals assessed on goods worth more than £20 were to pay 2s. per pound.On land, the threshold was again set at 20s, with those individuals possessing an annual income from land of between 20s and £5 paying a total of 8d. per pound across the three payments.  Again the rates rose according to wealth, with taxpayers possessing an annual income of between £5 and £10 paying 16d. per pound, those assessed between £10 and £20 paying 2s. per pound, and those assessed on a landed income of more than £20 paying the highest rate of 3s. per pound.On all assessments, aliens were to pay double these rates, and if they had no taxable property, were liable to pay a poll tax of 4d. (again payable in three instalments).  Corporations, gilds and fraternities paid the same double rate as aliens on both lands and goods.  Any taxpayer assessed on the £5, £10 or £20 thresholds was to pay at the relevant higher rate.The \'Act of Union\' of England with Wales of 1536 (27 Henry VIII, c. 26) had ordered that parts of Wales should be \'gildable\' or taxable from 1 November in that year, but Wales was specifically exempted from the subsequent subsidy, that of 1540.  However, in the \'Act of Union\' of England with Wales of 1543 (34 and 35 Henry VIII, c. 26), passed in the same Parliament as that of the present subsidy, it was stated that Welsh subjects should be liable to all subsidies and other charges granted by Parliament.  They were to pay all other rents, farms, customs and duties to the king, but fines for the redemption of Sessions, which it has been suggested, had come to replace occasional grants of taxation to the crown, were now remitted (Pugh, p 42).  The present subsidy was, therefore, the first to which Wales was generally liable since the early fourteenth century, and applied to persons born \'within this Realme of Englande, Wales or other the Kinges Dominyions\'.  Documents are extant for every county of Wales, athough condition and coverage varies from county to county.The subsidy was to be collected in three instalments.  Native taxpayers assessed on goods worth less than £20 or on lands worth less than £10 were to pay in three unequal instalments, the first payment comprising half the entire sum, to be followed by two payments of a quarter of the entire sum in each of the following two years.  Wealthier taxpayers (those assessed on £20 or more of goods or £10 or more in lands) were to pay in three equal instalments, due at the same times.  All alien taxpayers were to pay in the same unequal instalments, with the exception of those assessed on more than £20 in lands, who, like their native equivalents, paid in three equal payments.The commissioners were to divide themselves into regional groups and make assessments, after receiving their commissions by 6 August of each year (in 1543, 1544 and 1545).  Assessments were to be certified by 16 November annually, with payment by 6 February in 1544, 1545 and 1546.Henry VIII asked for an anticipation of the third payment in June 1545, asking that those assessed at more than £10 in goods or £5 in lands for the previous payment pay their tax at once, on the basis of the last assessment. E 179/109/288 states that payment of the anticipation was requested by 25 July, although Surrey and Oxfordshire assessments cite 15 July as the requested payment date (E 179/184/194, E 179/162/242), in Lancashire it was 15 or 16 July (E 179/130/136, E 179/130/146), in Dorset the payment date was 17 July (E 179/104/156), and in Warwickshire the payment was to be at the Exchequer by 24 July (E 179/192/160). In Staffordshire, however, the commissioners appointed to levy the anticipation had divided themselves between the hundreds by 24 June and assessments had been completed by 1 July (E 179/177/129).  A book recording details from the certificates returned for the levy of the anticipation survives at E 179/281/6.The net yields of the three instalments, as calculated by Dr. Schofield, are £76,606 for the first payment, £57,412 for the second and £54,959 for the third.(|Stat.

These dates may subsequently have been altered; the account for Lexden hundred in Essex for the first collection cites 1 April 1546 as the due date for payment, and certificates of exemption for Cinque Port barons in the rape of Pevensey in Sussex give 1 June 1546 as the date of the first payment (E 179/109/298; E 179/231/220).(|Stat.

249,1545 Nov 23 x Dec 24 ,subsidy ,Henry VIII ,"Parliament opened on 23 November 1545, and before the end of the first session on 24 December, granted a subsidy payable over two years.The rates charged on moveable goods were 8d. per pound for goods worth £5-10, 12d. per pound for goods worth £10-20, and 16d. per pound for goods worth over £20.  On lands, individuals with more than 20s. worth per annum paid 2s. per pound each year.  Provision was made for fractions of pounds to be taxed pro rata.  Aliens were taxed at the same rate as natives.The Act covered England and Wales, but exemptions included property or offices in Ireland, France, Jersey, Guernsey, the Cinque Ports and inhabitants of the northern counties of England. Assessments were to be made by 12 February in 1546 and 1547, certified by 10 March in 1546 and 1547, and payment was due at the Exchequer by 1 April in 1546 and 1547. The payment dates given in the statute, however, may have been modified: several accounts for the first payment were audited during Hilary term (24 January - 12 February) 1546, see for instance E 179/117/150 (the city of Hereford), E 179/170/217 (nine hundreds in Somerset), and E 179/192/174 (the city of Coventry). A certificate of assessment for the second payment in Norfolk cites a commission received 28 March 1547 (E 179/151/347). The returns for the second payment in Essex cite different dates as the date on which payment was due at the Exchequer.  E 179/109/300 and E 179/109/308 give 19 or 20 May 1547.  According to another return, payment was due on 31 May 1547 (E 179/109/313).  In Radnorshire, a date of 16 July 1547 is given for the second payment (E 179/224/558 and E 179/224/559).

366,1522 Sept or earlier ,forced loan from the laity and the clergy ,Henry VIII ,"In the early months of 1522, in view of the impending war with France, it was decided that a comprehensive survey was to be made of all England.  This survey, described by John Stow as a \'generall proscription\' and by Polydore Vergil as a \'census\', was two-fold in purpose.  The first was to establish the numbers of men available for military service, as well as the total amount of arms and armour at their disposal, and the second was to discover the wealth of the nation, both temporal and spiritual, information which was to be used for the levy of a forced loan.Commissions for the execution of the survey are thought to have been issued around 7 March 1522 by the lord chancellor, Cardinal Wolsey, who personally chose all the commissioners, and the survey was to be completed by Easter (20 April).  None of the commissions, nor the instructions given to the commissioners on how to carry out their task, are known to survive, although an extant letter from the Essex commissioners to the bailiff and chief constable of the half-hundred of Waltham reveals something of the procedure employed and the information sought.A muster of all laymen over the age of 16, arrayed for war, was to take place.  Constables of every hamlet, parish and village were to produce certificates at the muster recording the names of all adult male inhabitants, and their lords or landlords.  The certificates were also to provide the names of the lords of all towns and hamlets, and their stewards, the names of all parsons and the annual value of their benefices, and the names of all landowners in every town and the yearly value of their tenements.  They were also to list all stock and goods in the town and the names of their owners, as well as the names of all aliens, together with their country of origin and their occupations.  The \'value and substance\' of all persons, both lay and clerical, aged 16 or older, was to be provided, and details given of all pensions issuing from the town and paid to clerics.Such a complex survey was bound to occasion delay, but the whole exercise as initially carried out proved to be unsatisfactory, for some time in April the survey was temporarily abandoned.  Fresh commissions and instructions were issued in late July, which reveal that while the returns made of the military aspect of the survey were thought to be sufficient, the financial information yielded was not.  Wolsey\'s instructions complain of under-assessment; the true value of estates had been concealed by reason of \'favour affeccion and other colourable driftes and practises\', and the commissioners were to start all over again and search out the entire extent and value of men\'s lands and goods.  This time the investigation was to be made on the oath of each individual, rather than the certificate supplied by the parish or township, the veracity of which was to be checked with a panel of neighbours, if there was any cause for suspicion.  Hospitals, chantries and guilds were to be valued as well.  The instructions also contained a comprehensive description of the goods to be assessed, which was to include money, plate, jewels and household stuffs, as well as debts and obligations.  The commissioners were warned not to divulge the real purpose of the survey, but to state merely that the information was required so that a suitable rate could be found for a contribution to the \'furnisshing of harneys\'.  Only after the assessments were complete were they to assemble \'suche temporall personages as they shall think good\' and explain to them the king\'s necessity for money and plan to levy a general loan.The military surveys were to be returned to Star Chamber by late November.  Although 29 English counties are known to have sent in complete returns, and two others sent in partial returns, very few returns have survived, possibly because they were sent back to the counties for use in levying the \'amicable grant\' of 1525.  Those that do survive are of varying form and content, but all are of tremendous importance to historians.  One military survey (for Penwith hundred, Cornwall) has been found among the E 179 records, together with a fragment for Norfolk.  For a list of the extant surveys, many of which are now in print, see Hoyle, |Tudor Taxation Records| (London, 1994), pp 50-51.  To this list should be added BL, Harl Roll O.6, a survey of the three tithings of the hundred of Pitney in Somerset. The levy of the loan had begun by late summer, although it was delayed in those counties where the commissioners were slow to return their surveys.  It was to be levied upon all laymen with £20 or more in lands or goods.  The rates of payment were: those with between £20-300 were to pay 10% of their total income; those possessing an estate worth between £300-1,000 were to contribute 16.66% of their income; and those with £1,000 or more were to pay at a rate to be decided by the commissioners.  At the same time, members of the clergy were asked to lend 25% of their annual income to the crown.  This scale of contribution was unprecedented, and it is little wonder that the crown encountered a great deal of reluctance on the part of both commissioners and lenders (see the 1523 loan).Various loan books survive for individual counties and cities, usually referring to the loan as \'the first loan\', among the E 179 and other records in the PRO, and in county, local and private repositories, listed in Hoyle, |Tudor Taxation Records|, pp 51-53.  In addition to these, there is also a newly-discovered record of contributors to the loan in Derbyshire (E 179/91/143), and a loan book in the archives of Westminster Abbey, listing those payers and defaulters in Westminster and Middlesex (Westminster Abbey Muniments 12366).  Together with the loan levied in the following year, the receipts made of this loan from the laity eventually brought over £200,000 into the king\'s coffers.In a letter to Cardinal Wolsey about the assessment of the loan in his archdiocese, William Warham, archbishop of Canterbury, warned that the clergy were \'veray wel mynded to this loone...but ther substaunces of ther goods is not correspondent to ther good mynde\', and he urged caution in both the processes of assessment and collection, lest both the clergy and the laity be incited to oppose it (BL, Cotton MS Cleo, F.VI, fo. 342, printed in |Original Letters, Illustrative of English History|, ed. H. Ellis, 3rd ser., II (London, 1846), pp 29-35). Three assessments for the loans to be made by the clergy are known to survive.  The assessment of the archdiocese of Canterbury is now BL, Add MS 21946 and that of the diocese of London is BL, Harl MS 133. The assessment of the province of York, with annotations indicating receipt of the money in virtually every instance, is now E 179/239/224A.  On the basis of the assessments returned to him by the bishops of each diocese, he expected the overall yield of the loans made by the clergy to reach £60,000 (SP 1/25, ff. 168-200, calendared in |Letters &amp; Papers, Henry VIII|, III, no. 2483(1-3)), but it is not known how much was actually received. According to an extant collection list, the sum total received from the clergy of the northern province was £6,002 5s.6d. (E 179/239/224A).(|Letters &amp; Papers, Henry VIII|, III, no. 2483(3); IV, no. 214 and App. 37, cf. BL, Cotton MS Cleo, F.VI, fo. 272v; E 36/221, fo. 4; J.J.

367,1523 March or later ,forced loan ,Henry VIII ,"When the returns from the loan levied in autumn 1522 proved inadequate for the king\'s military needs, another loan was imposed on laymen in spring 1523, again based on the information provided by the comprehensive \'military survey\' of the previous year.In the imposition of this \'second loan\' the net was cast much wider.  Whereas only those possessing a total estate of £20 or more were asked to contribute to the 1522 loan, the minimum threshold of liability was now lowered to £5-20 in goods and 20s.-£20 per annum in lands, on which all liable persons were to lend 10% of their income.A number of loan books have survived in the PRO and other repositories; these are listed in Hoyle, |Tudor Taxation Records|, pp 51-53.  To this list should be added E 179/185/237F, which has been identified on the basis of internal evidence as a loan book of 1523 for the hundreds of Woking and Godley in Surrey, and Surrey Record Office, Guildford, LM 1502/1, a list of contributors to the loan in the hundred of Godalming in Surrey, attached to Henry VIII\'s promissory note for repayment.  An interim account rendered by the collectors of the loan in Godalming and Farnham hundreds also survives (LM 1502/2).  Evidence that Cheshire contributed to this loan is provided by two documents in series E 179:  E 179/85/1 and E 179/85/13.  Since the county generally claimed exemption from taxation until the 1530s, on the grounds that it was not represented in Parliament, this appears to be an attempt to widen the scope of revenue raising in time of need, to an area not normally included in taxation.Together with the 1522 loan, this loan raised over £200,000 for the king\'s war with France (see BL, Cotton MS Cleo. F.VI, fo. 272v, which lists the total amounts received from both loans, broken down by income bracket), but there is evidence that the loan commissioners were dilatory in carrying out their commissions, and that lenders were slow to pay.  Draft warrants from the king to the commissioners and collectors of both loans, written in May 1524, complain of incomplete returns and small numbers of contributors, and exhort the commissioners to use \'all wise and pollitique meanes\' at their disposal to solicit more contributions, which they were to bring to Westminster on 25 June.  Another warrant orders letters to be sent to a number of individuals who were delinquent in paying the loans assessed against them (BL, Harl MS 309, fos. 42v-43v).Both loans were to be repaid out of the next parliamentary grant.  Henry VIII gave promissory notes, pledging repayment to the inhabitants of various hundreds, cities and boroughs who had contributed, a few of which survive (BL, Add MS 27,402, fo. 36; BL, Stowe MS 146, fo. 135 - both given in April 1523).  The loans, however, were never repaid; nor were those imposed on the clergy in 1522.  A parliamentary act of 1529 released the king from any obligation to make repayment on the grounds that the money had been used exclusively for war purposes and might legitimately be termed taxation.(Goring, \'The General Proscription\', 700; |Gloucestershire, Military Survey of 1522|, pp xiii-xiv)declared account: E 36/221 ",Origin  Imposed,1st: 1523 Mar 0
369,1525 March 21 ,amicable grant from the laity and the clergy ,Henry VIII ,"The defeat and capture of Francis I by the Emperor Charles V at the battle of Pavia on 24 February 1525 created an excellent opportunity for Henry VIII to invade France, and soon after news of the battle reached London on 9 March, plans were made for an expedition.  In order to fund this campaign, the king was to exercise his royal prerogative and exact an \'amicable grant\' from his subjects.Commissions for the levy were issued on 21 March 1525, together with instructions to the commissioners.  One set of these |pro forma| instructions - those sent to the two senior commissioners appointed in Gloucestershire - survive in the archive of Berkeley Castle (Select Letters 2).  According to these, the certificates completed by local constables and bailiffs during the military survey of 1522 were to be sent to the commissioners and used as the basis of their levy, but they were also to include anyone who had previously escaped assessment.  The two senior commissioners were to order the sheriff to assemble all the other commissioners by 30 March, when they were to assess themselves.  The commissioners were to arrange bonfires and processions celebrating the capture of Francis I, and generally make the king\'s plea of necessity.  They were to divide themselves and summon the people before them in three groups, according to their wealth.  On the first day, those worth £50 or more were to come.  On the following day, those of the next income bracket (£20-50), and on the third day and subsequent days, those worth less than £20.  Payment of the grant might be in two instalments, but the first of these had to be in the hands of the treasurer of the king\'s chamber by Whitsuntide (4-6 June).Three different rates were to be assessed:£50 or more    - 3s.4d. per pound (one-sixth of their wealth)£20-50            - 2s.6d. per pound (one-eighth of their wealth)less than £20   - 2s. per pound (one-tenth of their wealth)There was no threshold below which persons were exempt from payment.  Anyone who refused to contribute was to be sent to the king.  But this threat was accompanied by other provisions meant to be persuasive; the clergy were to be more heavily charged than the laity, and indeed the instructions sent to the archbishop of Canterbury directed that all clergymen with £10 or more in goods or lands were to contribute a third of their higher valuation, and those with less than £10 were to pay a quarter (BL, Cotton Cleo MS F.VI, fos. 262-265v).  Archbishop Warham was pessimistic, however, on the clergy\'s ability to pay such sums and showed no enthusiasm for assessing the loan.  Another feature designed to please the laity was the concession that the contributions would be repaid if the expedition were cancelled.  Although this tax has always been thought to have been the brainchild of Cardinal Wolsey, the instructions laid great stress on the participation of the king in the decision to levy the grant.Despite the bonfires and other features of the \'amicable grant\' designed to appeal to the laity, the tax was deeply unpopular and met with resistance and refusal to pay in many parts of England.  Full-scale revolt erupted in Suffolk, with 10,000 men converging on Lavenham.  The high rates of taxation, short amount of time allowed for payment, and the general dearth of currency with which to pay, were all contributory factors, as was the fact that the subsidy of 1523 was still being levied.  The levy of the amicable grant brought about the collapse of all normal economic activity and by 13 May it was abandoned in favour of voluntary contributions.(G.W. Bernard and R.W.

370,1542 March or earlier ,forced loan ,Henry VIII ,"In March 1542, just after the second payment of the subsidy granted in 1540 was due to be collected, the king\'s finances were found to be wanting.  It was decided, therefore, that he would impose a forced loan on his subjects to raise the necessary funds for \'erecting and repairing castles and fortresses [in England] and at Calais and Guisnes,...making his haven at Dover, and...maintaining a great garrison to reduce Ireland\'.The commissioners appointed to levy the loan in each county were directed to assess themselves \'liberally\', before proceeding to rate the inhabitants of the rest of the shire, in accordance with the assessment made for the last subsidy, a copy of which was to be sent to the commissioners.  Those persons asked to lend were to have at least £50 in lands and/or offices per annum, or £100 in goods.  At least £10 was to be assessed on lands and £6.13s.4d. on goods in each hundred of the county.  If the commissioners found anyone \'stiff in condescending\' to lend, they were to use persuasion \'to draw him to some reason and honest consideration of his duty\', but if this course failed, they were to note his name and charge him to keep his refusal secret from his neighbours, lest he serve as an \'evil example to the rest\'.  The clergy were also asked to contribute, as a similar commission to the bishop of Bath and Wells makes clear.  The commissioners were to appoint collectors, who would be instructed to pay their receipts to Sir Edmund Peckham, the king\'s household cofferer.Money, plate and jewels were all to be accepted, and payment was to be made \'before midsummer next\', although a certificate of assessment for Suffolk cites the date of payment as 6 July (E 179/181/239), an estreat containing the assessment of contributors in Kent cites the due date for payment as 8 August (E 179/124/254), and another for Warwickshire states that payment was due on 1 August (E 179/192/150).  However, assessments of contributors in Sussex and Surrey both give the payment date as 24 June (E 179/231/218; E 179/184/185).  Upon payment a lender was to be given a privy seal letter, which was to serve as both a receipt and a promissory note for repayment.  One such letter is now Surrey Record Office, Guildford, LM 1502/3.  Lenders were to be repaid within the next two years.On 22 March 1542, the king appointed Peckham to be receiver-general of the loan, and on the following day privy seal letters, which were |pro forma| but differentiated by rank for the nobility, began to be delivered to him by the privy seal office.Total estimated receipts were £112,229.  Like the loans of 1522-3, the loan was retrospectively converted into a parliamentary grant, justified on the grounds of necessity for the defence of the realm, and consequently never repaid.(|Letters &amp; Papers, Henry VIII|, XVII, nos. 188-192, 194; Hoyle, |Tudor Taxation Records|, p 48; R.W.

The most prominent parishioners of every parish were to make the collection at the end of the six weeks from both the laity and the clergy.  The money collected was to be used to finance the campaign and was expected to exceed the 40,000 ducats advanced by Henry VIII to the King of the Romans by \'three or four times\'.A letter dated 27 October 1543 from Sir Edmund Peckham to the bishop of Bath, enclosing instructions for the sheriffs with jurisdiction within his diocese, gave directions that the money collected in the parish churches was to be paid to the sheriffs.  It was their responsibility then to deliver the money to Sir Edmund, cofferer of the king\'s household and receiver of the devotion money.  No other instructions regarding the administration of this prerogative tax are known to survive, although returns for Gloucestershire and the hundred of Ongar in Essex, the latter of which is dated 22 January 1544, are among the records of the lay subsidies in the E 179 class (E 179/114/260; E 179/109/289, 290).  There are several other returns among the records of the clerical subsidies in the E 179 class, including the return from the county of Cambridgeshire (E 179/278/47), parts of Brecknockshire (E 179/21/111A and E 179/21/111B), and Carmarthenshire (E 179/21/111C).Receipts totalled less than £2,000.(Hoyle, |Tudor Taxation Records|, p 38; |Letters &amp; Papers, Hen VIII|, XVIII (1),  no 955; XVIII (2), no 41; XVIII (2), no 315; C Kitching, \'Broken Angels: The Response of English Parishes to the Turkish Threat to Christendom, 1543-4\', in |The Church and Wealth|, ed.

372,1544 Aug 11 or later ,forced loan ,Henry VIII ,"On 14 July 1544 Henry VIII sailed to France to take charge of the war against the French.  By August, it was apparent that the campaign was to last longer than anticipated and that funds were needed to strengthen the strongholds established around Boulogne, and some time after 11 August (the date of an earlier draft letter) the king wrote to many of his leading subjects asking for loans.Only higher clergy, noblemen, high-ranking officers of the courts, and attorneys were approached.  The level of contribution ranged from £20 to the £1,333.6s.8d. given by the bishop of Bath and Wells, who resisted heavy pressure from the king\'s council to give £3,000.  Both the amounts sought from lenders and the actual amounts given can be ascertained.  A schedule of names of persons to whom letters were sent is printed in |Letters &amp; Papers, Henry VIII|, XIX (1), no 1032, together with a draft of the king\'s |pro forma| letter to them.  A list of just over 100 contributors to this loan in Gloucestershire is at E 179/114/232. The loans were received in September by Sir John Williams, treasurer of augmentations, whose final account, dated 29 September 1544, lists the contributors and amounts given and is printed in |Letters &amp; Papers, Henry VIII|, XIX (2), no 328.

373,1545 Jan ,benevolence from the laity and clergy ,Henry VIII ,"Further funds were needed for the defence of the recently conquered Boulogne and the continuing war with France, and rather than assemble a parliament and seek the grant of a subsidy, the king and his council resolved to levy \'a convenient mass of money by way of benevolence\'.On 5 January 1545 commissioners were appointed in all the counties, instructing them to assess themselves and then the other inhabitants of the shire.  They were to use the assessments made for the last subsidy as the basis of the rates that they would levy, making allowance for any adjustments in the value of estates, and dividing themselves into groups of two.  These groups would meet with those of the shire with whom they were acquainted and over whom they had influence.  They were then to summon these persons before them in groups of 10 or 12, and meeting with each individually, treat with them for as large a sum as they could afford, after they had reminded them of the king\'s military achievements and the danger to the realm posed by French attempts to recover Boulogne.  Those who pleaded poverty were to be urged by persuasion if possible, and sworn to secrecy and sent home if they still refused.  At least one person who refused - a London alderman, Richard Read - was sent to fight against the Scots, on the king\'s order.  The commissioners were to appoint receivers to collect the money and pay it to Sir Edmund Peckham, the king\'s cofferer, by Easter (5 April) 1545.  A list of the commissioners appointed in each county can be found in BL, Lansdowne MS 2, fo 32.Individuals in possession of 40s.-£20 in lands, or £3.6s.8d. (5 marks) - £20 in goods, were to be charged at a rate of 8d. per pound, and those with more than £20 in either category of wealth were to pay 12d. per pound.  Both laymen and clergy were to contribute.  However, the threshold was later raised to £5 in lands and £10 in goods.Sir Edmund Peckham\'s account for the benevolence survives, and total receipts from each county are also listed in |Letters &amp; Papers, Henry VIII|, XX (2), App 4.  Individual county returns can be found in E 179.  The total amount received has been estimated at £119,581.(|Letters &amp; Papers, Henry VIII|, XX (1), nos 17-18, 98; XX (2), App 4; Hoyle, |Tudor Taxation Records|, p 38; Hoyle, \'War and Public Finance\', p 93)enrolled account: E 370/2/23 ",Origin  Imposed,1st: 1545 April 5
374,1546 May 16 ,free and voluntary contribution from the laity and clergy ,Henry VIII ,"In order to provide the funds to repel a renewed French offensive in Boulogne and Calais, it became necessary to levy another prerogative tax, and on 16 May 1546 commissioners were appointed to seek a \'loving contribution\', usually referred to as the \'free and voluntary contribution\' (E 179/185/233).The contents of the instructions enclosed with the commissions are in many respects similar to the instructions issued for the levy of the benevolence of 1545.  The assessments made for the last subsidy were to be used as the basis for the charges, with allowances for changed circumstances, including the addition of new names.  The commissioners were to call before them all taxpayers in groups of 10 or 12, beginning with the wealthiest, and after declaring the king\'s purpose and necessity, were to persuade them to contribute \'with encouraging words\'.  They were to treat with each person individually, \'lest one unreasonable man go about to seduce the rest\', and request him to inform the commissioners of any who spoke against the contribution.  As in 1545, anyone who refused to pay was to keep quiet about it, although the king\'s council was to be certified of the commissioners\' proceedings with him, and the refuser would be required to appear before the council.  By 20 June the commissioners were to have appointed collectors, all of whom were to be substantial persons of at least £20 per annum of income from land or in possession of 500 marks\' worth of goods.Two different rates were to be imposed, depending upon whether the contributor was assessed on his lands or his goods.  A rate of 4d. in the pound was payable by all those holding lands to the value of 40s. per annum or more, and a rate of 2d. in the pound was chargeable to all those with goods worth £15 or more.  The tax was payable monthly for five months, beginning at the end of June 1546.  All clergymen with benefices worth £10 per annum or more were also to contribute.  Household servants without independent landed holdings of at least £10 per annum, or at least £15 worth of goods, were not liable to pay.These instructions survive in several copies and are calendared in |Letters &amp; Papers, Henry VIII|, XXI (1), no 844, and printed in full in |Illustrations of English History|, ed. E Lodge (1791), I, pp 71-77.The collectors were to pay the receipts of the contribution to Sir Edmund Peckham, the king\'s cofferer, who was appointed receiver-general by the king\'s letters patent on 18 June 1546 (E 179/241/320).  His accounts survive, although they are not complete.  Returns for individual counties can also be found in E 179, including that for Radnorshire at E 179/224/557, which states that monies were to be paid to the Lord President of the Council of the Marches.  In addition, on 2 February 1548 Peckham drew up a certificate of the arrears of the loans and prerogative taxes for the collection of which he had been responsible over the previous five or six years, now E 179/240/276.(Hoyle, |Tudor Taxation Records|, p 39)enrolled account: E 370/2/23 (incomplete) ",Origin  Imposed,"1st: 1546 June 30, 2nd: 1546 July 31, 3rd: 1546 Aug 31, 4th: 1546 Sept 30, 5th: 1546 Oct 31"
883,1512 March 24 or earlier ,"clerical subsidy of £25,084 from Canterbury province ",Henry VIII ,"The clergy of the southern province were summoned to a convocation at St. Paul\'s, London which began on 6 February 1512 and sat until 20 October 1512.  Before 24 March 1512, when the archbishop of Canterbury appointed the bishop of London his co-collector, the southern clergy had granted the king a subsidy of £24,000, from: (a) all the ecclesiastical goods, benefices, possessions, pensions and portions of the province; (b) all chantries worth 10 marks per annum or more; and (c) the goods, etc. of all alien priories, whether in lay or ecclesiastical hands.  An additional £1,084 was also granted for the costs of levying the subsidy and other expenses.The tax was granted for the defence and protection of the English church and was to be levied after the fashion of a clerical tenth, in portions assigned or to be assigned by the ordinary (or bishop) of the place, provided that no one be charged or burdened with more than he/she would normally pay in the levy of two tenths.  The subsidy was thus held to be equivalent to two tenths, and was often referred to as such by the collectors.Exemptions from the levy were to be granted at the discretion of the ordinaries, but also excused from payment of the tax were: (a) all benefices which were unofficed; (b) all ecclesiastical goods, benefices and possessions in the province of all the colleges, halls or collegiate houses of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, Eton College (in Buckinghamshire), Winchester College (in Hampshire) and Fotheringay College (in Northamptonshire); and (c) all ecclesiastical goods, benefices and possessions of Syon Abbey (in Middlesex), Sheen Priory (in Surrey), London Charterhouse and all other Carthusian houses in the province, the house of London Minoresses, the priory of St. Mary, Clerkenwell (in Middlesex), the abbeys of Godstow and Rewley (in Oxfordshire) and Barnwell Priory (in Cambridgeshire).All collectors of the tax were to be appointed by the ordinaries and could be compelled, if necessary, to undertake collection of the subsidy, but only in the dioceses where their monasteries, houses or habitations were located.  No one who had been present in the lower house of the convocation in which the tax was granted, whether in their own names or as proctors, was to be appointed as a collector.  Collectors were given the power to compel payment from taxpayers by ecclesiastical censures and by sequestration of their goods, but if they themselves did not collect the subsidy, or part thereof, as directed within 20 days of the specified date of collection, then they could be compelled to act by ecclesiastical censures and sequestration, imposed by the archbishop of Canterbury, in the same way as delinquent payers.  Defaulting taxpayers were to be given 30 days\' warning before their goods etc. were seized and their churches appropriated, and whatever was seized would be returned to them 30 days after they paid the tax.  All collectors unable, on their oaths, to collect the money due from defaulting or delinquent taxpayers, after 30 days\' warning given to the latter, were to be exonerated wholly from such collection by the archbishop of Canterbury and the bishop of London, and dismissed and acquitted.  The collectors were to receive 8d. in the pound for their labours and expenses, and no more, nor anything beyond the £1,084 granted by the clergy of the province for the expenses of collection.The tax was not to be paid into the Exchequer, but to the archbishop of Canterbury and bishop of London, at the chapter house of St. Paul\'s.  The bishops of each diocese were to appoint collectors of the first half of the subsidy and certify their names, together with those of all sub-collectors, to the archbishop and bishop by 20 May 1512.  They were also to inform the archbishop and bishop of amounts charged to each collector or sub-collector.  The first half of the tax was to be collected between 1 May and 7 July 1512.  The names of the collectors of the second half of the subsidy were to be certified to the archbishop and bishop by 20 December 1512, and the tax was to be collected between 30 November 1512 and 2 February 1513.(London, Guildhall Library, MS 9531/9 (Register of William Fitzjames, Bishop of London, ff. 44-46); M.

In addition to these rates, alien clergy paid two and a half to three times more in each category than native clergy, and a fifth class of taxpayer was added in which all alien clergy who were normally liable to pay tenths were to pay a fourth part of the annual value of their income.The tax was granted with these provisos: (a) that if any of those members of the clergy were liable to pay tax in more than one diocese or archdeaconry, or transfer from one to the other, so that it was difficult for the collectors, that they, or part of them, would be deputed to collect the tax, and their names, and the amounts to be collected, would be certified, so that they be exonerated; and (b) that any clergy liable to pay taxes with the laity were to be excused payment of this tax.Collectors were given the usual powers of ecclesiastical censure to compel payment, and were to receive 12d. in the pound for their costs and labour in collecting the tax.

The four tenths were to be collected from all ecclesiastical benefices and possessions in the province, both those assessed and accustomed to pay the tenth, and those not assessed to pay the tenth, and also from the ecclesiastical benefices and possessions of the alien priories, whether these were in lay or ecclesiastical hands.The tenths on the possessions of alien priories were granted under the following conditions: that all collectors of the tax were to be appointed by the ordinaries and could be compelled, if necessary, to undertake collection of the subsidy, but only in the dioceses where their monasteries, houses or habitations were located.  No one who had been present in the lower house of the convocation in which the tax was granted, whether in their own names or as proctors, was to be appointed as a collector.

888,1512 April 26 x June 12 ,two clerical tenths from York province ,Henry VIII ,"In response to a royal writ of 28 November 1511, the clergy of the northern province were summoned by the archbishop of York to a convocation at York, which began on 26 April 1512, and sat until 17 January 1513.  Before 12 June 1512, when commissions to collect the first payment of the tax were issued, the northern clergy granted the king a subsidy of two tenths of all ecclesiastical benefices and spiritual and temporal possessions, assessed to pay the tenth, according to the |Nova Taxatio|.  The grant was made for the salvation and defence of the universal and English church, and for a happy state of governance, and the tranquillity and utility of the king, and the defence of the realm of England.The conditions attached to the grant were: (a) that if any collector was unable to collect the sum due from any person, and he signified to the Exchequer the name of the defaulter and sum due, when making his account, then the collector would be exonerated for this sum, and the certificate of the collector or his attorney was to be accepted on this matter without further inquisition or delay; (b) that every collector appointed by the ordinary to collect the tenths or any part of them, when rendering his account at the Exchequer, shall have for the labours and expenses of himself and his servants 8d. from every pound of money which he has collected (i.e., 20s.); (c) that all collectors be admitted without delay to render their account in the Exchequer or elsewhere upon the collection and payment of the tenths and every part of them, and that no collector during such account be vexed or burdened by the clerks or ministers of the Exchequer or by any other person there by colour of any suit or any fee, but that after the rendering of their account, all collectors be immediately freely dismissed without having to make any payment or promise of money; and (d) that if any prelates or clergy possessing and obtaining any benefices or ecclesiastical possessions within the province are compelled, commanded or obliged by mandate or authority the archbishop of York, or anyone else, to resist the Scots, or other enemies of the realm of England, or expel any invasions by them in their own persons, or provide, find or send any armed men to do so at their own cost and expense, then the grant will be cancelled and cease to have any effect. Wholly excused from payment of these tenths were:(a) all ecclesiastical benefices with cure of souls assessed at 8 marks per annum or less;(b) the ecclesiastical benefices and spiritual and temporal possessions of all nuns, because of their notorious poverty;(c) the ecclesiastical benefices and spiritual and temporal possessions of all monks of the Carthusian order within the northern province; (d) all ecclesiastical benefices within the province appropriated to colleges, halls and houses of the universities of Cambridge and Oxford;(e) the churches of Huntington and Ferry Fryston, with its portion (in Yorkshire), appropriated to the vicars choral of York Minster;(f) the churches of Misterton (in Nottinghamshire) and Topcliffe (in Yorkshire), appropriated to the use of the fabric of York Minster;(g) the churches of Kneesall and Barnby in the Willows (in Nottinghamshire), appropriated to the use of the vicars choral of Southwell Minster;(h) the church of Harewood (in Yorkshire), appropriated to the priory of Bolton in Craven, on account of the diminution of its fruits, rents and provents, and its excessive assessment;(i) the portions in the collegiate churches of Chester le Street and Lanchester (in Durham), on account of their poverty and the diminution of their fruits;(j) the temporalities of the abbey of Meaux (in Yorkshire), devastated by floods and horrible tempests of the sea and the Humber, so that the abbot be bound to pay the two tenths for the assessed benefices and possessions which have not been laid waste, the £8 4s. 9 1/2d. which he has been accustomed to pay in the payment of every whole tenth, as appears by divers inquisitions taken by command of the king touching the lands and possessions which have been laid waste, exemplified by letters patent under the seal of the Exchequer and exhibited in this convocation, the burden of this payment having been imposed on the said abbot by his express consent and with the authority of convocation;(k) all benefices, ecclesiastical possessions, pensions and portions within the archdeaconry of Northumberland not assessed by the |Nova Taxatio|, except for the sum of £10 for each of the two tenths, for the temporalities within the archdeaconry which remain to be paid according to the old assessment (i.e., of 1291), payment of which was to be apportioned according to the discretion of Thomas, bishop of Durham; and(l) the church of Tankersley (in Yorkshire), on account of the great diminution of its fruits by the withdrawal of its lands and fields from cultivation to herbage and pasture.Excused from payment of half of the levy, paying, then only a moiety of each tenth, were:(a) the spiritual possessions and temporalities of the monasteries of Drax, Ellerton and Helagh Park (all in Yorkshire), on account of their notorious poverty, and grave damages and charges which they sustained in the lands, possessions and buildings, caused by flooding and fire in their houses and buildings; (b) the churches of Danby Wiske (in the archdeaconry of Richmond, in Yorkshire), Bainton, Huggate and Haughton-le-Skerne (in the archdeaconry of Durham), and Staunton [in le Vale?] (in the archdeaconry of Nottingham), the vicarage of Darrington (in the archdeaconry of York), and the prebend of Langtoft in York Minster, because of the great diminution of their fruits and provents, and their excessive assessment; and (c) the dean of York Minster.Excused from payment of payment of one-third of the first tenth and one-half of the second tenth were:(a) the benefices, ecclesiastical possessions and spiritualities and temporalities of the priory of Watton and Ferriby (in Yorkshire) and Rufford and Mathersay (in Nottinghamshire); and (b) the churches of Brompton (in the archdeaconry of Cleveland) and Patrington (both in Yorkshire), on account of the diminution of their fruits and provents.Excused from payment of the second half of both tenths were:(a) the benefices, ecclesiastical possessions and spiritualities and temporalities of the monasteries of Egglestone, Holy Trinity, York (both in Yorkshire) and Felley (in Nottinghamshire), (b) the temporalities of the priory of St Andrew, York; (c) the churches of Kirby Wiske and Rowley (in Yorkshire); and (d) the vicarage of Withernsea (in Yorkshire).Excused from payment of the third part of both tenths, paying, thus two-thirds of each tenth, were:(a) the church of Middleton on the Wolds (in the arcdeaconry of East Riding) and the vicarage of Skipwith (in Yorkshire), on account of the diminution of their fruits and their excessive assessment.Excused from payment of a third part of the second of the two tenths were:(a) the benefices and spiritual and temporal possessions of the priory of Shelford (in Nottinghamshire); (b) the hospital of St James, Northallerton, with the church of Thornton le Street (in Yorkshire), appropriated to it; and (c) the prebends of Skelton and Saltmarsh in the collegiate church of Howden (in Yorkshire), on account of their excessive assessment.All collectors were to be appointed by the bishops or ordinaries, and in the case of anyone bound to pay the tenth who refused or delayed payment, upon 14 days\' warning having been given to the person either by writing or by posting notice on the doors of their churches or residences, the collectors had the power by authority of convocation to compel the defaulter by ecclesiastical censures, that is, by sentences of suspension, excommunication or interdict, or by other lawful remedies.  Upon the receipt of full payment, the collectors could release him from any sentence, censure or pain promulgated against him for this reason, provided that the delinquent payer first reimburse the collector for all expenses incurred by the collector on account of the delay, and revoke any process made by the collector against the defaulter.  Defaulting taxpayers were to be given 30 days\' warning before their goods etc. were seized and their churches appropriated, and whatever was seized would be returned to them 30 days after they paid the tax.  All collectors unable, on their oaths, to collect the money due from defaulting or delinquent taxpayers, after 30 days\' warning given to the latter, were to be exonerated wholly from such collection by the Exchequer, and dismissed and acquitted.Commissions for collection were issued on 12 June 1512.  The first tenth was to be collected on 1 August 1512 and paid into the Exchequer by 2 February 1513, and the second was to be collected on 3 May 1513 and paid into the Exchequer by 1 August 1513.The collection arrangements were subsequently altered by order of Henry VIII, under his \'letters of placarde\'. Issued under his signet at his manor of Bishop\'s Waltham on 8 August 1512, these letters effected the appointment of a general receiver for the whole province of York, Edmund, abbot of St. Mary, York, and an overseer, Master Thomas Magnus, archdeacon of East Riding. The collectors appointed to collect the tax in all the archdeaconries were to pay their proceeds not into the Exchequer but to the abbot, receiving in return a tripartite indenture of receipt, sealed by all three parties. Seven of these tripartite indentures evidently made their way into the Exchequer and are found today in the E 179 series (E 179/64/295A, mm. 1-6, 8).

The first half of the first whole tenth was to be collected on 2 February 1518 and paid into the Exchequer by 3 May 1518, and the second half of the first tenth was to be paid on 2 February 1519 and paid into the Exchequer on 3 May 1519.  The first half of the second whole tenth was to be collected on 2 February 1520 and paid into the Exchequer on 3 May 1520, and the second half of the second tenth was to be paid on 2 February 1521 and paid into the Exchequer on 3 May 1521.The collection arrangements were subsequently altered by order of Henry VIII, under his \'letters of placarde\'. Issued under his signet at Windsor Castle on 6 January 1518, these letters effected the appointment of a general receiver for the whole province of York, Edmund, abbot of St. Mary, York. The collectors appointed to collect the tax in all the archdeaconries were to pay their proceeds not into the Exchequer but to the abbot, receiving in return an indenture of receipt, sealed by both parties. A number of these indentures evidently made their way into the Exchequer and are found today in the E 179 series (E 179/64/299, mm. 2, 3, etc.).Accounts and correspondence of the collector of tenths in the diocese of Durham, for the years 1504-19 survive among documents formerly in the archive of Durham Cathedral Priory, now Durham University Library, Archives and Special Collections, Dean and Chapter, Locelli XVIII-XIX.(Wilkins, |Concilia|, III, p 659; Bray, |Records of Convocation, XIV, pp. 171-83; Borthwick Institute, Register of Thomas Wolsey, Archbishop of York, Register 27, ff. 112v-115v)Enrolled Account: E 359/17, rots 46-46d, 50-51d  ",Origin  Granted,"1st: 1518 Feb 2, 2nd: 1519 Feb 2, 3rd: 1520 Feb 2, 4th: 1521 Feb 2"

Before dispersing on 20 December 1514 they granted the king a subsidy of two tenths of all ecclesiastical benefices and possessions in the province, both those assessed and accustomed to pay the tenth, and those not assessed to pay the tenth, and also from the ecclesiastical benefices and possessions of the alien priories, whether these were in lay or ecclesiastical hands.The tenths on assessed benefices were granted under the following conditions: no one who had been present in the lower house of the convocation in which the tax was granted, whether in their own names or as proctors, was to be appointed as a collector.  Any refusal to collect the tax made by an appointed collector was to be certified to the Exchequer, and that collector would then be charged with collecting the tax at his own expense, but collectors could not be appointed to collect the tax outside their own diocese.  All collectors unable, on their oaths, to collect the money due from defaulting or delinquent taxpayers were to be exonerated wholly from such collection at the Exchequer when rendering their accounts, and dismissed and acquitted.  When accounting, no collector was to be vexed or burdened by any clerks or ministers of the Exchequer, or by any other person there, by colour of any writ or suit or fee or any other demand of money, but that after rendering account all collectors were to be immediately be freely dismissed without having to make any payment or promise of money.  Any disputes or differences between the collectors and the Exchequer were to be interpreted and decided by the archbishop of Canterbury and the bishops of London, Winchester, Norwich, Rochester and Ely, or any two or three of them.

894,1523 Aug 14 ,clerical subsidy from Canterbury province ,Henry VIII ,"The clergy of the province were assembled in convocation at St. Paul\'s, London, on 20 April 1523.  Twice summoned to Westminster to meet with Cardinal Wolsey, they sat until 14 August 1523, when they granted the king an unprecedently large subsidy to pay for the wars in France and Scotland.  Indeed, reference was made to the unusual size of the burden in the long preamble of the text of the grant, the clergy stating that such a gift had only been granted because of the extreme necessity of these wars and protesting that it was not to be taken as an example or precedent for future grants.The tax granted was a three-tiered graduated tax on the annual income of every cleric in the province.  All clergy drawing an annual income of £8 or more were to pay one-half of that income, those with an annual income of less than £8 were to pay one-third, and those members of the clergy who were certified by their ordinary (or bishop) as being in a state of extreme poverty were to pay one-fourth.  All alien clergy had to pay half their income, plus another one-fourth (i.e., three-quarters of their income), except for Jerome Ghinucci (bishop of Worcester), George de Athegua (bishop of Llandaff), Polydore Vergil, Peter the Carmelite, Erasmus of Rotterdam, Sylvester Darius (a papal collector and member of the bishop of Worcester\'s household) and Peter Vannes (Latin secretary to Henry VIII and Cardinal Wolsey), who were to pay the same rates as English denizens.  Payment of the tax was spread in equal instalments over five years, however, so that the highest rate taxpayers paid only one-tenth of their income each year, and taxpayers of the second rate band paid one-fifteenth of their income each year, etc.  Payment was to be made on 30 April in 1524-1528, and the grant carried the proviso that if the king was still at war and his need for funds still urgent, then the last payment due on 30 April 1528 could be advanced to 31 October 1527.All collectors of the tax were to be appointed by the ordinaries and could be compelled, if necessary, to undertake collection of the subsidy, but only in the dioceses where their monasteries, houses or habitations were located.  No one who had been present in the lower house of the convocation in which the tax was granted, whether in their own names or as proctors, was to be appointed as a collector.  Collectors were given the power to compel payment from taxpayers by ecclesiastical censures and by sequestration of their goods, but if they themselves did not collect the subsidy, or part thereof, as directed within 20 days of the specified date of collection, then they could be compelled to act by ecclesiastical censures and sequestration, imposed by the archbishop of Canterbury, in the same way as delinquent payers.  Defaulting taxpayers were to be given 30 days\' warning before their goods etc. were seized and their churches appropriated, and whatever was seized would be returned to them 30 days after they paid the tax.  In the event of members of the clergy who were liable to pay the tax in more than one diocese or archdeaconry, or who transferred from one to the other, so that it was difficult for the collectors to collect the tax, the collectors, or part of them, were to be deputed to the other diocese(s) etc. to collect the tax, and their names and the amounts to be collected were to be certified, so that the collectors could be exonerated.  All collectors unable, on their oaths, to collect the money due from defaulting or delinquent taxpayers, after 30 days\' warning given to the latter, were to be exonerated wholly from such collection by the archbishop of Canterbury and the bishop of London, and dismissed and acquitted.  The collectors were to receive 8d. in the pound for their labours and expenses.Excused from payment of the tax were: (a) members of all colleges or collegiate halls in the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, Winchester College (in Winchester), Eton College (in Buckinghamshire) and Fotheringay College (Northamptonshire); (b) the abbey of Syon (in Middlesex), all Carthusian houses in the province, the house of London Minoresses and the priory of Dartford (in Kent); (c) the abbot of St. Albans (an office then held |in commendam| by Cardinal Wolsey himself); and (d) all dilapidated monasteries with more than £50 in expenses.The tax was not to be paid into the Exchequer, but to the archbishop of Canterbury and bishop of London, at the chapter house of St. Paul\'s.  The bishops of each diocese were to appoint collectors and certify their names, together with those of all sub-collectors, to the archbishop and bishop, as well the amounts charged to each collector or sub-collector.  The archbishop of Canterbury and bishop of London were to receive 1/4d. in the pound for their costs and would be acquitted by the king\'s great seal upon payment of their receipts to the treasurer of the king\'s chamber.  Neither they nor any collector were to be brought before the Exchequer or the king\'s council for accounting purposes, and if they were molested by any spiritual or temporal person on this account, then the grant would be rendered null and void.  In the event of any disputes, the archbishop of Canterbury and bishop of London were to serve as adjudicators.The most revolutionary aspects of this tax were the process and basis of its assessment.  A new, comprehensive assessment was made according to precise instructions laid down by Cardinal Wolsey, and many institutions and individuals who had escaped taxation under the old |Taxatio| were now included, such as chantries and endowed grammar schools, and pensioners and stipendiary clergy.  The benefices and endowments themselves were not taxed, however, but the individuals who held them, so that both curates and those paid pensions from livings each paid their share, not only the incumbents.  Certain deductions were allowed in the estimates of income, such the costs of repairs to rectories (including those in the churches) and vicarages, and stipends paid to curates.  From surviving assessments it appears, however, that in some cases only a portion of the amount claimed by the incumbent for repairs was allowed, and in other cases, it appears that the curate\'s stipend was not deducted from the incumbent\'s assessment, so that a double tax was levied.The assessment was undertaken by the bishops\' auditors and commissaries in each diocese, who were to hold inquisitions into the annual value of cathedrals, colleges, hospitals, religious houses of all kinds, benefices, pensions, stipends and chantries within their remit.  All clergy were to divulge the true value of their income to the commissaries \'|absque dolo, fraude, excusacione aut colore|\'.  In addition to the expenses of repair and the payment of stipends to vicars, chanters or chaplains, other \'ordinary expenses\' were to be deducted from their taxable income.  These included visitation procurations and |synodalia|, corrodies, pensions, portions, fees of farms, Peter\'s Pence and the formal obligations of alms.  After notification of the valuations, the archbishop of Canterbury was then to assess the tax after the appropriate rate.Cardinal Wolsey estimated that the total revenue from the subsidy (from both provinces) would be £120,000, and he attempted to obtain an \'anticipation\' of the first payment in the autumn of 1523.  A surviving letter from the king to the vicar-general of the diocese of Worcester dated 2 November 1523 required the anticipation to be levied and sent to St. Paul\'s by the end of November.  All those with an annual income of £20 or more were to be asked for their first payment in advance and their names and offices held were to be enrolled in a book enclosed with the letter. (For a receipt given to the rector of Allesley (in Warwickshire) for his payment in anticipation, see E 179/363/343.)Total receipts of the subsidy are not known, but the assessment procedure does not appear to have operated smoothly.  In the diocese of Lincoln, all clergy were required by the bishop to appear before him or his commissary in order to make \'|meliorem et efficatiorem inquisicionem|\' regarding the value of their rents and incomes; several were subsequently pronounced contumacious for their non-appearance.  Six of the collectors in the same diocese were ordered to be suspended by the archbishop of Canterbury and bishop of London for inadequate receipts for the first tenth, although only one collector was actually suspended.  Where the assessments made survive, however, they are invaluable sources of information about both the clergy and its wealth.An interesting draft of the subsidy act survives among the Cartae Miscellaneae of Lambeth Palace Library (CM I/83a), and a list of the total amounts assessed in each diocese of the province for the first tenth is now Lambeth Palace, CM I/76.  Original returns from the diocese of Lincoln, apparently for the first tenth, are now among the archives of Lincoln Cathedral Library, and a volume of assessments of the whole diocese for the third tenth in the same repository, dated 1526, has been edited by H.E. Salter in |A Subsidy Collected in the Diocese of Lincoln in 1526| (Oxford Historical Society, LXIII, 1913).  The latter is evidently a copy of the assessment of 1524, with amendments to the assessment made in 1526 added. A subsidy book, also for the diocese of Rochester, covering the years 1523-33 is now Centre for Kentish Studies, Maidstone, DRb/A/z/1, which contains a recital of the 1523 subsidy act and the assessment of the diocese for the first tenth.  Other assessments await discovery.(Wilkins, |Concilia|, III, pp 699-700; M.

895,1523 Aug 18 ,clerical subsidy from York province ,Henry VIII ,"By a royal writ of 28 February 1523, the clergy of the northern province were summoned to a convocation at York on 22 March 1523.  This assembly was adjourned to Westminster Abbey on 22 April 1523, and after various prorogations it resumed on 17 August 1523.  On the following day the clergy granted the king the same subsidy which had been granted by the southern convocation a few days earliers and were dismissed.As in the south, the tax granted was a three-tiered graduated tax on the annual income of every cleric in the province.  All clergy drawing an annual income of £8 or more were to pay one-half of that income, those with an annual income of less than £8 were to pay one-third, and those members of the clergy who were certified by their ordinary (or bishop) as being in a state of extreme poverty were to pay one-fourth.

Commissions to the chief collectors were issued on 10 January 1524.  The bishops of each diocese were to appoint collectors and certify their names, together with those of all sub-collectors, to the chief collectors, as well the amounts charged to each collector or sub-collector.

The benefices and endowments themselves were not taxed, however, but the individuals who held them, so that both curates and those paid pensions from livings each paid their share, not only the incumbents.  Certain deductions were allowed in the estimates of income, such the costs of repairs to rectories (including those in the churches) and vicarages, and stipends paid to curates.  From surviving assessments it appears, however, that in some cases only a portion of the amount claimed by the incumbent for repairs was allowed, and in other cases, it appears that the curate\'s stipend was not deducted from the incumbent\'s assessment, so that a double tax was levied.The assessment was undertaken by the bishops\' auditors and commissaries in each diocese, who were to hold inquisitions into the annual value of cathedrals, colleges, hospitals, religious houses of all kinds, benefices, pensions, stipends and chantries within their remit.  All clergy were to divulge the true value of their income to the commissaries \'|absque dolo, fraude, excusacione aut colore|\'.  In addition to the expenses of repair and the payment of stipends to vicars, chanters or chaplains, other \'ordinary expenses\' were to be deducted from their taxable income.  These included visitation procurations and |synodalia|, corrodies, pensions, portions, fees of farms, Peter\'s Pence and the formal obligations of alms.  After notification of the valuations, the archbishop of York was then to assess the tax after the appropriate rate.Cardinal Wolsey estimated that the total revenue from the subsidy (from both provinces) would be £120,000, and he attempted to obtain an \'anticipation\' of the first payment in the autumn of 1523, at least in the southern province.  All those with an annual income of £20 or more were to be asked for their first payment in advance and their names and offices held were to be enrolled in a book enclosed with the letter.  Whether the wealthier taxpayers in the north were also asked for an \'anticipation\' is uncertain.Whether the assessment process in the north was as problematic as that in the southern province is not known, but in total contrast with the situation in the southern dioceses, the survival rate of the assessments made in the province of York is rather good. At least one assessment survives from all five archdeaconries in the diocese of York, and they are invaluable sources of information about both the clergy and its wealth.A copy of the assessment of the archdeaconry of York for the first payment, dated February 1524, together with fragments of assessments in the same archdeaconry and in the diocese of Durham for other payments, are now E 179/64/300 (parts 1 and 2). An incomplete assessment of York archdeaconry (for another payment of the tax) is now E 179/64/331, and a third assessment of York archdeaconry, made for the second payment in 1525, is now Sheffield Record Office, BFM 65.The assessment of the archdeaconry of Nottingham and collegiate church of Southwell for the fourth payment of the tax, made in February 1527, and including some of the text of the tax grant, is now PRO, E 315/412. The assessment for the fifth payment of the same, made in February 1528, is now E 179/64/302 and E 179/64/304.The assessment of the archdeaconry of Cleveland, dated February 1528, now E 179/64/303, has been printed in T.M.

896,1531 Jan 24 ,clerical subsidy from Canterbury province ,Henry VIII ,"The clergy of the province of Canterbury assembled in convocation at St. Paul\'s, London, on 5 November 1529, and after various prorogations, the king ordered them to re-convene \'for urgent reasons\' at Westminster Abbey on 21 January 1531.  Having charged several of the leading prelates and clergy of the province with violating the statute of |praemunire| in the previous year, the king now demanded the grant of a subsidy of £100,000, plus all expenses to be incurred in its collection, estimated at £3,444.  In return, he offered the clergy of the province \'his generall and gracious pardon of all their trespasses of penall lawes and statutes of this Realme\' (J.A. Guy, \'Henry VIII and the Praemunire Manoeuvres of 1530-1531\', |EHR|, XCVII (1982), p 488).  Several of those indicted for submitting to Cardinal Wolsey\'s papal legacy had in fact been ardent protestors against the 1523 subsidy, and it has been argued by Professor Guy that their arrest was motivated, at least partly, by the king\'s desire to procure an equally large clerical subsidy in 1531.  Just three days after the clergy had re-convened at Westminster, on 24 January 1531, they agreed to grant the subsidy.  In order to reduce the likelihood that the grant would furnish a precedent for other such gifts, the clergy stated that they were making the grant as a reward to the king for his efforts in repressing Lutheran heretics.The terms of the levy of the subsidy were virtually identical to those of the subsidy granted in 1523. The tax to be paid was a three-tiered graduated tax on the annual income of every cleric in the province.  All clergy drawing an annual income of £8 or more were to pay one-half of that income, those with an annual income of less than £8 were to pay one-third, and those members of the clergy who were certified by their ordinary (or bishop) as being in a state of extreme poverty were to pay one-fourth.  Payment of the tax was spread in equal instalments over five years, however, so that the highest rate taxpayers paid only one-tenth of their income each year, and taxpayers of the second rate band paid one-fifteenth of their income each year, etc.  All alien clergy had to pay double the ordinary rates, with certain exceptions.All collectors of the tax were to be appointed by the ordinaries and could be compelled, if necessary, to undertake collection of the subsidy, but only in the dioceses where their monasteries, houses or habitations were located.  No one who had been present in the lower house of the convocation in which the tax was granted, whether in their own names or as proctors, was to be appointed as a collector.  Collectors were given the power to compel payment from taxpayers by ecclesiastical censures and by sequestration of their goods, but if they themselves did not collect the subsidy, or part thereof, as directed within 20 days of the specified date of collection, then they could be compelled to act by ecclesiastical censures and sequestration, imposed by the archbishop of Canterbury, in the same way as delinquent payers.  Defaulting taxpayers were to be given 30 days\' warning before their goods etc. were seized and their churches appropriated, and whatever was seized would be returned to them 30 days after they paid the tax.  In the event of members of the clergy who were liable to pay the tax in more than one diocese or archdeaconry, or who transferred from one to the other, so that it was difficult for the collectors to collect the tax, the collectors, or part of them, were to be deputed to the other diocese(s) etc. to collect the tax, and their names and the amounts to be collected were to be certified, so that the collectors could be exonerated.  All collectors unable, on their oaths, to collect the money due from defaulting or delinquent taxpayers, after 30 days\' warning given to the latter, were to be exonerated wholly from such collection by the archbishop of Canterbury and the bishop of London, and dismissed and acquitted.  The collectors were to receive 8d. in the pound for their labours and expenses.Excused from payment of the tax were: (a) members of all colleges or collegiate halls in the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, Winchester College (in Winchester) and Eton College (in Buckinghamshire); (b) the abbey of Syon (in Middlesex) and all Carthusian houses in the province.The tax was not to be paid into the Exchequer, but to the archbishop of Canterbury and bishop of London, at the chapter house of St. Paul\'s.  The bishops of each diocese were to appoint collectors and certify their names, together with those of all sub-collectors, to the archbishop and bishop, as well the amounts charged to each collector or sub-collector.  The archbishop of Canterbury and bishop of London were to receive 1/4d. in the pound for their costs and would be acquitted by the king\'s great seal upon payment of their receipts to the treasurer of the king\'s chamber.  Neither they nor any collector were to be brought before the Exchequer or the king\'s council for accounting purposes, and if they were molested by any spiritual or temporal person on this account, then the grant would be rendered null and void.  In the event of any disputes, the archbishop of Canterbury and bishop of London were to serve as adjudicators.Assessment of the tax was to be made, just as for the subsidy granted in 1523.  It was made by the bishops\' auditors and commissaries in each diocese, who were to hold inquisitions into the annual value of cathedrals, colleges, hospitals, religious houses of all kinds, benefices, pensions, stipends and chantries within their remit.  All clergy were to divulge the true value of their income to the commissaries \'|absque dolo, fraude, excusacione aut colore|\'.  In addition to the expenses of repair and the payment of stipends to vicars, chanters or chaplains, other \'ordinary expenses\' were to be deducted from their taxable income. Like that granted in 1523, the subsidy was to be collected in five equal annual instalments of £20,000 each, but the dates of payment proved to be bones of contention. The subsidy act itself was not finalised until 4 March 1531, when convocation agreed that the king was to be deemed \'supreme head\' of the church, and in return he agreed not to \'anticipate\' the first payment of the subsidy (PRO, E 135/8/36). The tax would be paid annually, beginning on 25 March 1532, and the king agreed that 10,000 marks might be held over in arrears until 1537.The last £20,000 was remitted with the passage of the first fruits and tenths act in 1535.  By March 1536, £69,432 17|s|.5 1/2|d|. of the £80,000 owed had been paid.  There was, however, opposition to the levy of the subsidy from some sections of the lower clergy.  When John Stokesly, bishop of London, attempted to assess the London chantry clergy in August 1531, the lower clergy, especially the stipendiaries and chaplains, rioted.  Excommunications of these members of the clergy for this reason survive in PRO, C 85/126/35A, 35B, 36-8, 40, 40A, 40B.Various returns for this tax survive in other repositories, probably all diocesanal copies. A subsidy book from the diocese of Bath and Wells, for 1533, is now Somerset Record Office, Taunton, D/D/Vc20, and a subsidy book from the diocese of Rochester, covering the years 1523-33, is now Centre for Kentish Studies, Maidstone, DRb/Az1.Three returns are extant from the diocese of Coventry and Lichfield, two of which contain collection lists of clergy in the archdeaconry of Stafford: (1) a collector\'s book for the first payment in 1531, now Staffordshire Record Office, Lichfield, B/A/17/1(1); and (2) A similar book for the third payment, levied in 1533. The third return comprises a full list of taxpayers for the whole diocese of Coventry and Lichfield, also for the third payment, is now BL, Harl. MS 594, ff. 117v-154v. Prefaced by the certificate sent to the bishop of London by the keepers of spiritualities in the diocese, naming the collectors appointed in each archdeaconry (f. 116), this list gives both the names and surnames of the individual taxpayers and the amount of tax that each paid.(Wilkins, |Concilia|, III, pp 742-744; Rymer, |Foedera|, XIV, pp. 413-416; Lambeth Palace Library, CM I/55; PRO, E 135/8/36; E 179/277/9; J.A.

897,1531 May 4 ,clerical subsidy from York province ,Henry VIII ,"In response to a royal writ of 7 December 1530, the clergy of the province of York assembled in convocation at York on 12 January 1531.  Two days later, on 14 January, the clergy released the king from repaying to the clergy of the province all sums of money loaned to him.  Convocation continued to sit until 4 May 1531, when the clergy granted the king a subsidy of £18,840 10|d|.Following the lead of the southern clergy, this subsidy was presumably levied in the same way as the 1523 subsidy, as a three-tiered graduated tax on the annual income of every cleric in the province.  All clergy drawing an annual income of £8 or more were to pay one-half of that income, those with an annual income of less than £8 were to pay one-third, and those members of the clergy who were certified by their ordinary (or bishop) as being in a state of extreme poverty were to pay one-fourth.  All alien clergy had to pay double these rates.  Payment of the tax was spread in equal instalments over five years, however, so that the highest rate taxpayers paid only one-tenth of their income each year, and taxpayers of the second rate band paid one-fifteenth of their income each year, etc.All collectors of the tax were to be appointed by the ordinaries and could be compelled, if necessary, to undertake collection of the subsidy, but only in the dioceses where their monasteries, houses or habitations were located.

All collectors unable, on their oaths, to collect the money due from defaulting or delinquent taxpayers, after 30 days\' warning given to the latter, were to be exonerated wholly from such collection by the chief collectors, and dismissed and acquitted.  The collectors were to receive 8d. in the pound for their labours and expenses.Excused from payment of the tax were: (a) members of all colleges or collegiate halls in the universities of Oxford and Cambridge; and (b) all dilapidated monasteries with more than £50 in expenses.The tax was not to be paid into the Exchequer, but to the abbot of St. Mary, York, the chief collector, by 31 May each year.  The bishops of each diocese were to appoint collectors and certify their names, together with those of all sub-collectors, to the chief collectors, as well the amounts charged to each collector or sub-collector.  The chief collectors were to receive 1/4d. in the pound for their costs and would be acquitted by the king\'s great seal upon payment of their receipts to the treasurer of the king\'s chamber.  Neither they nor any collector were to be brought before the Exchequer or the king\'s council for accounting purposes, and if they were molested by any spiritual or temporal person on this account, then the grant would be rendered null and void.

In addition to the expenses of repair and the payment of stipends to vicars, chanters or chaplains, other \'ordinary expenses\' were to be deducted from their taxable income.  These included visitation procurations and |synodalia|, corrodies, pensions, portions, fees of farms, Peter\'s Pence and the formal obligations of alms.Like that granted in 1523, the subsidy was to be collected in five equal annual instalments, beginning on 25 March 1532.  The last instalment was remitted with the passage of the first fruits and tenths act in 1535.(Wilkins, |Concilia|, III, pp 698-699; |The Registers of Cuthbert Tunstall, Bishop of Durham, 1530-59, and James Pilkington, Bishop of Durham, 1561-76|, ed.

898,1534 Nov 3 x Dec 18 ,clerical tenths in perpetuity ,Henry VIII ,"In the parliament that assembled at Westminster on 3 November 1534 and sat until 18 December 1534, the passage of the act of first fruits and tenths removed from the clergy in convocation the right to consent to taxation of the clergy.  This revolutionary measure was anticipated by the first statute passed in this parliament by which Henry VIII was given the title of \'supreme head of the church of England\' and the authority to reform and redress all heresies and abuses in that church (26 Henry VIII, c. 1).  It was now within the power of the king himself to decide how to tax the clergy of his church and he no longer had to ask for grants of taxation from the clergy of the two provinces.The act provided that all members of the clergy, upon promotion to a benefice or office (including election to the head of a monastic house, cells excluded) would pay the king the equivalent of the first year of the revenues and profits of that benefice or office.  This new arrangement simply superseded the previous obligation to pay the first year\'s fruits of office to the pope - the tax formerly known as \'annates\'.  Under the new act, the clergy were required to compound and give bonds for the payment of the first fruits of their benefice before specially-appointed commissioners.  This proved to be a hugely profitable arrangement for the crown.In addition to the payment of first fruits, the act also instituted the payment of tenths as an annual and permanent levy.  The tax to be paid was the value of the tenth part of all revenues, rents, farms, tithes, offerings, emoluments and other profits, both spiritual and temporal, that belong to any archbishopric, bishopric, abbey, monastery, priory, archdeaconry, deanery, hospital, college, collegiate house, prebend, cathedral church, collegiate church, conventual church, parsonage, vicarage, chantry, free chapel or other benefice or spiritual promotion in England or Wales.  It was to be paid in one annual payment at Christmas and was to reach the Exchequer by the following 1 April.The value of all ecclesiastical possessions in every diocese was to be established by a valuation carried out by commissioners appointed by the chancellor of England.  They were \'to examyn, serche and enquyre by all the wayes and meanes that they can by their dyscrecions\' all forms of ecclesiastical income, deducting the allowable expenses of: rents reserved to feudal lords, alms payable \'by reason of any foundacion or ordynaunce\', all fees for stewards, receivers, bailiffs and auditors, synodal dues and proxies.  Other allowable deductions were any annual fees that archbishops, bishops, abbots, priors or other prelates had to pay to any chancellor, master of the rolls, justices, sheriffs or other officers or ministers of records, \'for temporal justice to be done or mynstred within their dyoces or juridiccions\'.  Any incumbent benefice holder who was charged to pay a pension to his predecessor was to be allowed to retain the tenth part of that pension, instead of paying a tenth to the crown for it, and no pensions beyond one-third of the value of any benefice were to be reserved henceforth to anyone vacating a benefice.  Before undertaking their task, the commissioners, three of whom could form a |quorum|, were to swear oaths before the chancellor that they would fulfill their commission \'without favour, affeccion, fraude, covyn, mede, drede or corrupcion\'.The commissioners were to certify the Exchequer of their valuation and it was then incumbent upon the bishops of each diocese to administer the collection of the tax. They appointed sub-collectors to gather in the tax revenue, but were themselves ultimately responsible for the tax to be paid in their dioceses.  In cases of vacancy of the see, the dean and chapter was responsible for the collection.  Any defaulting taxpayers would be deprived of their benefices or offices by their bishop after 40 days.  If collectors certified to the Exchequer, however, by 24 April, or Ascension day, or if the Court of Exchequer was not sitting (an adjustment to procedure made in 1536), that they were unable to collect the tax, then they would be discharged from responsibility for its collection, and the defaulter would be subject to Exchequer process against him to recover the outstanding amount.  No officer of the Exchequer was allowed to charge a fee for discharging any collector when he rendered his account.The valuation carried out by the commissioners, known as the |Valor Ecclesiasticus|, assigned a taxable value to even the most impoverished benefices and the higher clergy found themselves paying at more realistic, but far higher, levels than before.  The combination of higher assessments and new demands became potentially explosive.  The support which the Yorkshire and Lincolnshire clergy gave to the revolts of 1536 was fuelled in part by resentment at the impositions of the government, and the archbishop of York was reluctant to collect the tenth in his diocese in 1537.  A long-term problem with the collection of the tenths was that the dissolution of the monasteries in 1536-40 meant that the most reliable source of sub-collectors was lost to the bishops.  Many laymen ended up being appointed sub-collectors.  Laymen who acquired ex-monastic lands after the dissolution were required by statute to continue to pay the tenth originally imposed by the act of 1534 (27 Henry VIII, c. 27, no. VIII).  By another statute passed in the parliament that began on 4 February 1536, all students, clergy and other members of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, Eton College and Winchester College were excused payment of both first fruits and tenths (27 Henry VIII, c. 42). The receipts of the first fruits and clerical tenths from the inception of their collection were handled by the treasurer of first fruits and clerical tenths, John Gostwick, a personal servant of Thomas Cromwell, who was appointed to this office in May 1535.  He accounted directly to Cromwell, while the accounts of the episcopal collectors of the tenth were audited by the Exchequer.  At the end of 1540, after the fall of Cromwell in July of that year, the Court of First Fruits and Tenths was created by statute to receive both taxes and Gostwick was appointed its first treasurer (32 Henry VIII, c. 45).  He was also ordered to render account for the first six years preceding the court\'s establishment; thereafter annual accounts were standard practice.  Two auditors of the court assumed responsibility for examining the accounts for the tenths from 1540.  The individual collector prepared his account in draft (often much later) and it was then presented to the auditor and engrossed.A number of these draft accounts for twelve dioceses have survived and, together with the accounts rendered by Gostwick and his successors, are listed in P. Carter, \'The Records of the Court of First Fruits and Tenths: 1540-54\', |Archives|, XXI (1994), pp 65-66; |idem|, \'The Records of the Court of First Fruits and Tenths: A Revised List\', |Archives|, XXII (1995), pp 77-79.  Bundles of writs, etc. for levying arrears, from 1541-52, also survive in PRO, E 347/3/1, E 347/17 pt 1 and E 347/19.  There is at least one document in E 179 relating to the payment of this subsidy: E 179/43/275 is a list of arrears in London diocese, for the period 1539-47.  Accounts and collectors\' books for both tenths and subsidies levied in Lincoln diocese from 1535-54 is now Lincolnshire Archives Office, Lincoln, Subsid. 1/7-14, and a collector\'s book for the tenth in the diocese of Bath and Wells, from the late 1530s, is now Somerset Record Office, Taunton, D/D/Vc67.The Court of First Fruits and Tenths was abolished with other autonomous revenue courts in January 1554 and control over clerical taxation passed to the Exchequer, although an autonomous Office of First Fruits and Tenths was established within the Exchequer and the same administrators were appointed its co-remembrancers for life.  Receipts from the tenths were, however, paid directly by collectors to the Exchequer tellers, and their accounts, together with those of the remembrancers, were declared before a baron of the Exchequer.On 3 December 1555, after the accession of Queen Mary to the throne, the Office of First Fruits and Tenths was abolished by statute and control over clerical taxation returned to the convocations of the clergy.  The payment of first fruits to the crown was ended, and although the payment of tenths was to continue, these were no longer a royal tax paid to the crown, but were to be retained by the church and used for the payment of pensions of the ex-religious  (2 &amp; 3 Philip &amp; Mary, c. 4).In the first parliament of the reign of Elizabeth I, which began on 23 January 1559, an act was passed for the restitution of first fruits and tenths to the English crown, citing the disinheritance and decay in the crown\'s income which had resulted from Queen Mary\'s abolition of first fruits and tenths.  The bill was passed on 22 March 1559.  Both were again to be paid to the crown, but were to come under the survey of the Exchequer; the Court of First Fruits and Tenths was not revived.  A new threshold of liability for the payment of first fruits was enacted, however.  No vicarages valued at £10 or less and nor any parsonages valued at 10 marks (£6 13s. 4d.) or less were liable to pay first fruits, to take effect retrospectively, from 29 September 1558.  A new exemption from the payment of both first fruits and tenths was granted, moreover, to the dean and canons of the free chapel of St. George, Windsor and all hospitals founded for the relief of the poor and all schools (1 Elizabeth, c. 4).  Also excepted from the payment of tenths were the dioceses of Ely and Oxford, where they were regranted to the sees as partial compensation for the inequitable exchanges of lands which the queen had extracted from her bishops.Collectors\' accounts from the diocese of Durham, for the years 1562-66, are now Durham University Library, Archives and Special Collections, CC Brpc Box 23.

899,1540 July 24 or earlier ,clerical subsidy ,Henry VIII ,"The clergy of both provinces assembled in convocation in London on 14 April 1540, two days after parliament had been convened.  In the days that followed, probably around the time that the laity voted the king a subsidy (8 May), but certainly before 24 July when parliament was prorogued, the whole clergy granted a subsidy - the first since the passage of the act of first fruits and tenths - before turning their attention to the proposed marriage of the king to Anne of Cleves.  Henceforth, all grants made by the clergy were subject to the authority of and had to be confirmed by parliament.  Such grants were accordingly enrolled with all other parliamentary statutes.  Convocation was dissolved, on the king\'s orders, on 28 July 1540.The subsidy granted was a tax of 4s. in the pound on income from all manner of benefices and clerical offices, and was to be paid by every archbishop, bishop, dean, archdeacon, prebendary, provost, master of college, master of hospital, parson, vicar, chantry priest and all other members of the clergy \'enjoying any spiritual promotion or other temporal possessions annexed to the same spiritual promotions\'.  The subsidy was to be levied according to the valuation made for first fruits and tenths, that is, the |Valor Ecclesiasticus| made in 1535, with deduction made for payment of the tenth part of their income, under the act of first fruits and tenths.  They were to be taxed for the subsidy, therefore, on nine-tenths of their income.Anyone subject to first fruits, that is, who was in the first year of promotion to a benefice or office, was wholly exempt from payment of this subsidy.  Also exempt from payment of the subsidy were any benefices belonging to any college within the universities of Oxford or Cambridge, or to Eton College or Winchester College, or any benefices liable to pay fifteenths or other lay subsidies.  Any clergy in receipt of a pension as a result of the dissolution of the monasteries was, however, liable to pay the subsidy on the income of his/her pension, and this tax was to be deducted from the payment of these pensions by the Court of Augmentations.  The chancellor of the Court of Augmentations was to retain this tax money, notifying the Exchequer of the names and amounts of the pensions by 2 February of each year, and then pay it over to the Exchequer.  Anyone else liable to pay the subsidy who was also charged with paying pensions to the ex-religious were similarly to be allowed to retain the 2s. in the pound in each of the two years, and were likewise to certify the Exchequer of the names and amounts by 2 February each year, and then pay it over to the bishop or collector of the subsidy in their diocese.  Lay farmers or other lessees of forms of spiritual income were likewise liable to pay the subsidy of behalf of their landlords, unless they could produce any writings, covenants or bonds that showed otherwise.  The tax was to be paid over two years, so that all those liable to pay would be charged a rate of 2s. in the pound each year.Unbeneficed clergy in receipt of an annual stipend were to pay a flat rate of 6s.8d. per annum in each of the two years.  The bishop or archbishop of each diocese was to certify the Exchequer of the names and the value of the stipends paid to these stipendiary priests by 2 February in each of the two years.The subsidy was to be collected by the bishops and their appointees in every diocese, or by the dean and chapter in the case of a vacant see, in the same way and with the same powers as episcopal collectors had under the act of first fruits and tenths.  Like the tenths, the subsidy was to be paid in one annual payment at Christmas and was to reach the Exchequer by the following 1 April.  Any defaulting taxpayers would be deprived of their benefices or offices by their bishop after 40 days.  If collectors certified to the Exchequer, however, by 24 April, or Ascension day, if the Court of Exchequer was not sitting, that they were unable to collect the tax, then they would be discharged from responsibility for its collection, and the defaulter would be subject to Exchequer process against him to recover the outstanding amount.  Collectors were to account at the Exchequer, and were to be allowed 6d. of every pound for the charges of \'collection, portage, saufe conveying and paying\' of the subsidy, and were to receive an acquittance when accounting, for which acquittance the accountant would be charged the sum of 6d. for each acquittance.Like the tenths collected under the act of first fruits and tenths, the receipts of the subsidy were handled by the treasurer of first fruits and clerical tenths, John Gostwick, a personal servant of Thomas Cromwell, who was appointed to this office in May 1535.  He accounted directly to Cromwell, while the accounts of the episcopal collectors of the tenth were audited by the Exchequer.  At the end of 1540, after the fall of Cromwell in July of that year, the Court of First Fruits and Tenths was created by statute to receive first fruits and the clerical tenths and subsidy and Gostwick was appointed its first treasurer.  From 1540 Gostwick was to render annual accounts for these receipts, and two auditors of the court assumed responsibility for examining the accounts.  The individual collector prepared his account in draft (often much later) and it was then presented to the auditor and engrossed.A number of these draft accounts for several dioceses have survived and, together with the accounts rendered by Gostwick and his successors, are listed in P. Carter, \'The Records of the Court of First Fruits and Tenths: 1540-54\', |Archives|, XXI (1994), pp 65-66; |idem|, \'The Records of the Court of First Fruits and Tenths: A Revised List\', |Archives|, XXII (1995), pp 77-79.  Bundles of writs, etc. for levying arrears, from 1541-52, also survive in PRO, E 347/3/1, E 347/17 pt 1 and E 347/19.

The assembly was prorogued several times and was not dismissed until 28 March 1544.  Before 12 May 1543, however, when parliament was prorogued, they granted the king a subsidy of 6s. in the pound, to be paid over three years.The terms and conditions of payment, collection and administration of this subsidy were the same as those of the subsidy granted in 1540, with only a few modifications.  The tax of 2s. in the pound per annum was on income from all manner of benefices and clerical offices, and was to be paid by every archbishop, bishop, dean, archdeacon, prebendary, provost, master of college, master of hospital, parson, vicar, chantry priest and all other members of the clergy \'enjoying any spiritual promotion or other temporal possessions annexed to the same spiritual promotions\'.

Valuations of the newly-created bishoprics were to be made by the archbishop of the province and of new deaneries by the relevant bishop and certified to the Court of First Fruits and Tenths by 25 December 1543.  Allowable deductions from the taxable value of these new bishoprics, deaneries etc. were whatever portions of their revenue had been given for the maintenance of \'poore men, gramarions, queresters, students and other officers and ministers not to be charged with any part of this subsidie\'.As before, anyone subject to first fruits, that is, who was or will have been promoted to a benefice or office between 25 December 1542 and 25 December 1545, was wholly exempt from payment of this subsidy for the first year of his promotion.

901,1545 Dec 24 or earlier ,clerical subsidy ,Henry VIII ,"The clergy of the southern province were summoned, by a royal writ of 22 September 1545, to re-convene at Eton College on 24 November 1545. Before 24 December 1545, when the first session of parliament was prorogued, the clergy had granted, for both provinces, a subsidy of 6s. in the pound, to be paid over two years, that is, at a rate of 3s. in the pound in each year. The grant was made to help with the costs of maintaining the king\'s armies in Scotland and France.Otherwise the subsidy granted contained most of the same provisions as that granted in 1543.  The tax of 3s. in the pound per annum was on income from all manner of benefices and clerical offices, and was to be paid by every archbishop, bishop, dean, archdeacon, prebendary, provost, master of college, master of hospital, parson, vicar, chantry priest and all other members of the clergy \'enjoying any spiritual promotion or other temporal possessions annexed to the same spiritual promotions\'.

Also exempt from payment of the subsidy were any benefices belonging to any college within the universities of Oxford or Cambridge, or to Eton College or Winchester College, or any benefices liable to pay fifteenths or other lay subsidies.Any clergy in receipt of a pension of more than 40s. per annum as a result of the dissolution of the monasteries and hospitals was, however, liable to pay the subsidy on the income of his/her pension, and this tax was to be deducted from the payment of these pensions by the Court of Augmentations.  This threshold of liability of 40s. was a new provision of this subsidy.  The chancellor of the Court of Augmentations was to retain this tax money, notifying the Exchequer of the names and amounts of the pensions by 1 May of each year, and then pay it over to the Exchequer.  Anyone else liable to pay the subsidy who was also charged with paying pensions to the ex-religious were similarly to be allowed to retain the 3s. in the pound in each of the two years, and were likewise to certify the Exchequer of the names and amounts by 1 August each year, and then pay it over to the bishop or collector of the subsidy in their diocese.

281,1606 May 17 ,three subsidies ,James I ,"Parliament opened on 5 November 1605, but it was not until 17 May 1606 that it granted three subsidies to the king, payable in six instalments over three years.The rates were the same as in previous subsidies, and each subsidy was to be paid in the same two unequal payments.  On moveable goods worth £3 or more, individuals (and corporations) were to pay 1s.8d. per pound for each of the first payments (that is, the first, third and fifth instalments), and 1s. per pound for each of the second payments (i.e. the second, fourth and sixth instalments).  On lands worth 20s. or more per annum, they were charged with paying 2s.8d. for the first payments, and 1s.4d. for the second payments.   On moveable goods, aliens had to pay a double rate of 3s.4d. for the first payments, and 2s. for the second payments, and on lands, they were to pay 5s.4d. for the first payments, and 2s.8d. for the second payments.  Those aliens without taxable assets paid a poll tax of 4d. per head for each payment of the three subsidies.The first payment was to be assessed by 20 June, certified at the Exchequer by 20 July and paid by 1 August 1606; the second, assessed by 20 March, certified by 20 April and paid by 1 May 1607; the third, assessed by 20 September, certified by 20 October and paid by 1 November 1607; the fourth, fifth and sixth assessed by 20 March, certified by 20 April and paid by 1 May each year (1608, 1609, 1610).  Separate provisions were made for collections in Wales (excluding Monmouthshire) and Cheshire, where royal tenants and others were contributing to the mise on the accession of James I.  These places were only to make payments towards the subsidy after the date of the last instalment of the mise; this date was to be certified in the Exchequer by 18 October 1606.  The six collections of the subsidy were then to be made by 1 August next after the date of the final payment of the mise, by the subsequent 1 May and 1 November, and then by 1 May in the three subsequent years.  Surviving Welsh documents, such as E 179/219/61 for Brecknockshire, show that in some areas, payment was delayed by many years.  This document, dated in 1635, refers to the delay in collection as \'respited in respect of mizes then in paying and of many other intervenient chargs since\' and is not unique in showing such late payment.In addition to the assessments surviving in the E 179 class for the various counties, a book recording interim accounts rendered for the second payment (that is, the second payment of the first subsidy) is now E 179/276/19, and a register of the commissioners and collectors appointed to assess and collect the third payment (i.e., the first payment of the second subsidy) is at E 179/265/24.

Before the session was adjourned on 23 July, it granted a subsidy, to be paid in two unequal instalments, as well as a fifteenth and tenth.The rates were the same as in previous subsidies.  On moveable goods worth £3 or more, individuals (and corporations) were to pay 1s.8d. per pound for the first payment, and 1s. per pound for the second payment.  On lands worth 20s. or more per annum, they were charged with paying 2s.8d. for the first payment, and 1s.4d. for the second.  Aliens were charged a double rate of 3s.4d. for the first payment, and 2s. for the second payment, on moveable goods, and on lands, they were to pay 5s.4d. for the first payment, and 2s.8d. for the second.  Those aliens without taxable assets paid a poll tax of 4d. per head for each payment.The first instalment was to be assessed by 20 September, certified at the Exchequer by 20 October and paid by 1 November 1610; the second had to be assessed by 20 March, certified by 20 April and paid by 1 May 1611.  Special provisions for collection were once again made for Wales (excluding Monmouthshire) and Cheshire, where instalments of the previous subsidies were still being collected, on account of the collection of the mise.  Collections of the present subsidy were delayed, only to be paid by 1 November next after the date of the final instalment of the previous grant and by the subsequent 1 May.  Among surviving Welsh documents, the assessment at E 179/224/517 for Pembrokeshire states that the commission to collect both instalments together was dated 5 April 1629, showing evidence of this delay.In addition to the returns surviving among the E 179 documents, a composite volume containing certificates of residence of individuals assessed in several counties for the first payment of this subsidy is now E 315/524.(|Stat.

284,1621 Jan 30 x Feb 17 ,two subsidies ,James I ,"Although originally due to begin on 16 January, after two prorogations Parliament eventually opened on 30 January 1621.  A letter of 17 February 1621 recorded in |CSP Dom, 1619-23|, p.225 shows that by that date a grant of two subsidies had been made in anticipation of war in the defence of the Palatinate, although long discussions in committees meant that the bill did not receive royal assent until 22 March, by a commission dated 21 March (|Stat. Realm|, IV, p 1208).  The roll of statutes enacted in this parliament is lacking, and the act for the subsidies is consequently not included in the printed statutes, but a copy of the act has recently been located among the State Papers, from which it is evident that the act was written before 26 March 1621 (SP 46/65, fos. 122-140).Commissioners to levy the first subsidy were to receive their commissions by 26 March 1621, and the assessment was to be completed by 31 March 1621, certified at the Exchequer by 20 April 1621 and paid in one payment on 1 May 1621.  A letter from the council to Lord Zouche cites the payment date of the first subsidy as 10 May 1621, however, and the account of the collectors of Hastings rape in Sussex gives 1 June 1621 as the date on which this subsidy was to be paid (E 179/291/10).  The rates for this subsidy were 4s. per pound on landed income, levied on all individuals and corporations holding lands valued at 20s. or more per annum.  Those with goods worth £3 or more paid a tax of 2s.8d. in the pound (E 179/193/279; E 179/259/1).  Aliens were to pay double these rates, and if not liable in either category of wealth, were charged with a poll tax of 8d. per head.The second subsidy was to be levied in two unequal payments, though the thresholds of liability remained the same as for the first subsidy, in both categories of wealth.  For the first payment for the second subsidy, the commissions were to be received by the commissioners by 20 July 1621, and the assessment was to be completed by 31 August 1621 and certified at the Exchequer by 30 September 1621; payment was due on 1 November 1621.  The rates levied on land for this payment were 2s.8d. per pound, and on goods, 1s.8d. per pound.  Aliens were again to be charged double these rates, and those without any taxable property were liable for an 8d. per head poll tax - 4d. for each payment of the second subsidy.  Letters from commissioners for assessment indicate that assessment for this first payment of the second subsidy took place from August to October 1621.Commissioners for the second payment of the second subsidy were to receive their commissions by 20 January 1622, and the second payment was to be assessed by 28 February 1622, certified by 31 March 1622 and paid on 1 May 1622.  The rates levied for this payment were 16d. per pound on land, and 12d. per pound on goods (E 179/193/285; E 179/193/286).  These rates are confirmed in letters from the council to Lord Zouche.A roll containing a form of writ to commissioners to collect the  first collection, for English counties up to Sussex, is now at TNA: PRO C 212/22/20; similar rolls for the second and third payments for England and Wales are at C 212/22/22 and C 212/22/21.In addition to the returns made by the commissioners among the documents grouped under individual counties in E 179, there is a paper book of interim accounts for several counties, for the period Easter term 1621 to Easter term 1624 (E 179/266/25).  This book lists persons exempt from the tax, including much of the king\'s household, and gives dates of payments made by the collectors.Although no records for this subsidy for Caernarfonshire survive in E 179, a copy of a commission to collect a subsidy, dated 22 March 1621, for Caernarfonshire, probably relating to this subsidy, is in the National Library of Wales, ref. Brogyntyn Estate Papers TH1/2 (formerly Brogyntyn 3329), and mention is made of the order to collect a subsidy, probably the third collection, in a letter dated 8 February 1622 (Brogyntyn MSS (Clenennau Letters and Papers) 412 (NLW Film 1034)).  An assessment for the hundred of Rhuthun for the first collection of this subsidy is also in the National Library of Wales, ref. Wynnstay Deeds Box 68/36.  An assessment for the north part of the hundred of Bradford, Shropshire, dated 17 April 1621, presumably for the first collection, is in the National Library of Wales, ref. Plas Yolyn 423.  This is clearly the collector\'s copy, as many entries for individuals are marked with a cross, presumably to denote payment, and some are annotated \'a certificate\', presumably to denote a certificate of residence or exemption, for example.  An assessment for the third collection for the hundreds of Coleshill, Rhuddlan and Prestatyn, Flintshire, dated 19 February 1622, is also in the National Library of Wales (H. R.

Individuals and corporations paid 2s.8d. per pound for moveable goods worth £3 or more, and 4s. per pound for land worth 20s. or more per annum.  Aliens paid double these rates (5s.4d. per pound on goods and 8s. per pound on lands), and those aliens without taxable assets paid an 8d. per head poll tax for each subsidy.The first subsidy was to be assessed by 20 June, certified at the Exchequer by 30 June and paid by 10 July 1624; the second was to be assessed by 10 October, certified by 30 October and paid by 10 December 1624; and the third was to be assessed by 10 March, certified by 30 March and paid by 10 May 1625.A roll containing a form of writ to commissioners to collect the first subsidy in England and Wales is now at TNA: PRO C 212/22/23.A book recording the payments into the Exchequer made by the collectors of the third of these subsidies, together with the dates of payment, is at E 179/265/27.  In addition to the assessments among the E 179 documents, a paper volume, now BL, Add MS 21,047, contains the assessment for the third subsidy of the hundred of Colneis in Suffolk.

376,1604 July 31 ,privy seal loan ,James I ,"Because a subsidy was not granted in James I\'s first parliament, which was prorogued on 7 July 1604, his council decided to issue privy seals for forced loans in 1604-5 to both the laity and clergy (SP 14/8, nos 108-110, 113, 118).An original privy seal letter sent to a Norfolk widow survives in BL, Egerton MS 806, on fo 39.  This form letter, printed in the elegant |civilite| type, dated 31 July 1604, makes much of the king\'s necessity for money, speaking of \'great and urgent occasions falne and growing dayly upon us\', and complains of \'more extraordinarie occasions of large expence, out falling on the necke of another without time or respiration, then ever lighted upon any king of this realme\'.  It points out also that there had been no grant of subsidies to James I by parliament.  The recipient was required to pay the sum of £20, which was also printed - not left blank - to the Norfolk collector, Sir Charles Cornwallis within twelve days and would be repaid on 24 March 1606.  The letter bears the annotations that the loan of £20 was paid in October 1604 and repaid on 9 May 1608.However, a letter dated 14 February 1605 in the National Library of Wales, states that £25 had been paid for a privy seal in Caernarfonshire (Wynn of Gwydir 337), by 25 January 1605 (Wynn of Gwydir 331).  At least nine privy seals are known to have been issued in that county, and £235 collected (Wynn of Gwydir 337).  The collector, Sir John Wynn, had been requested on 15 December 1604 to return monies received to the Exchequer and certify the names of all those who refused to pay, with their reasons (Wynn of Gwydir 319), and another letter warned that \'the king will take notice of all who do not pay the loans\' (Wynn of Gwydir 320).  This seems to have been the case, as Sir John was requested on 6 August 1606 to send a certificate to the Lord Treasurer, of the names of those who had refused to subscribe to the loan, together with the amounts they were to lend, omitting only those who had been excused payment (Wynn of Gwydir 407).  It seems that in Caernarfonshire the names of those who had paid were not specified either, as previously, on 2 July 1606, the Lord Treasurer had requested a list of names, which was duly submitted (Wynn of Gwydir 400, with list of names appended).  Little is known about the experience of other Welsh counties, although it appears that the counties of Brecknockshire and Radnorshire may have petitioned for exemption (Wynn of Gwydir 320).A warrant, dated 10 December 1606, was sent by the lord treasurer to the tellers in the Exchequer receipt authorising them to repay those who had lent money in August and September 1604.  An accompanying letter from the lord treasurer indicates that it was a conscious policy that repayment of the loan was to be made first to the earliest lenders, and that a book of their names was to reside with one of the tellers, so that the lenders\' prompt payment could be verified.  The lenders were to be repaid from the first of three subsidies granted in 1606, but as only little more than a third of this subsidy had been paid in as of 10 December 1606, repayment of all the later lenders was to be delayed (BL, Lansdowne MS 156, fo 84). The loan brought in £111,891 in amounts ranging from £2,000 (advanced by the lord treasurer himself) down to payments of £12-£50.  A list of the amounts lent in August 1604 by the privy council is in BL, Lansdowne MS 164, fo 516.  There are also papers relating to the loan in BL, Cotton MS Titus B.V, fos 184-192.(Dietz, |English Public Finance, 1558-1641|, p 115; SP 14/17, no 86, \'the Book of the Loane, 1605\'; E 351/2,584-5) ",Origin  Imposed,1st: 1604 Aug 12
377,1609 Feb 25 or earlier ,aid to knight the king\'s eldest son Henry ,James I ,"In order to provide much needed revenue, it was decided that the king would levy a feudal aid to knight his eldest son Henry, who was about to be invested as Prince of Wales.  As it was a long time since such a tax had been levied, some research was necessary in order to ascertain the customary and statute law on feudal aids, and the types of tenancies upon which they could be levied.  Among the sources consulted were a copy of Magna Carta printed in June 1556, a ruling of Justice John Cokayne in 11 Henry IV on the liability of lands held in \'grand serjeantie\' and a statute of 25 Edward III.  It was established from this investigation that the only types of land tenure still existing that were chargeable for feudal aids were lands held by knights\' fees or in socage (SP 14/43, nos. 100-106, 108).Before 25 February 1609, when their first delivery to the commissioners was recorded, instructions were issued to the commissioners in each county appointed to levy the aid.  Two lists of the names of these commissioners survive (SP 14/43, no. 107; E 179/283/12).  They were directed to hold public meetings throughout their county to which they were to summon juries comprised of \'the sufficientest of the freeholders\' of the area, as well as all the king\'s freeholders in every parish.  Constables and other local officers were also to appear before the commissioners and present to them the names of all the king\'s freeholders, the size and location of their holdings and their yearly values.The commissioners, at least some of whom were to be lawyers, were to explain to the assembled freeholders that the king was entitled at common law to demand a feudal aid.  At first the aid was due only \'by the ancient common laws\' and to be imposed \'by discretion reasonably\', but a statute of 25 Edward III established that the king could demand 20s. per knight\'s fee and 20s. for each £20 worth of lands held in socage.  If necessary, the commissioners were to declare the reasons why such an aid had not been levied \'of late tymes\', informing the freeholders that Henry VII \'had satisfaction by parliament both for Prince Arthur...and for the Lady Margaret\', and that before his reign, the records show that aids had been customarily levied whenever \'there was cause\'.They were to state further that the king\'s purpose was \'not to search into the estates\' of any of his subjects, \'nor exactly to know the quantities or worths of the lands\', nor to list their tenures, nor to \'strayne their values\', nor to have \'any record made or certified for any other use then for the taxation of this aid\'.  He desired only to be satisfied of his rightful due \'of aid moderately valued\'.  The commissioners were to advise each freeholder to \'make no unnecessary opposition but quietly yield\' to the king no less than a third of the \'true improved value\' of his holdings \'after a moderate valuation\'.  Since the king\'s subjects knew so well the values of each others\' estates, only an estimate by which \'the king may not be wronged nor the subject pressed to the highest\', was required.  A second set of instructions, issued on 19 March, expressed the hope that the king\'s subjects would not take the amounts paid in the levy of a subsidy as their guideline - a damning comment on the accuracy of the subsidy assessments, if ever there was one (BL, Cotton MS Cleo. F.VI, fos 314-316v; see also SP 14/43, no. 111).The commissioners were to proceed by the long and circuitous route of jurors\' inquests, and levy the rates provided by the statute of 25 Edward III, |only| in the event that the king\'s subjects were \'willful or obstinate\', and refused to make composition.  If they found the jurors to be partial in the subjects\' favour, they were to inform the parties involved that they had \'authority by the law to tax them without jury\', should it prove necessary.  Various guidelines were then laid down for the valuations to be made by jury and the procedures to be followed, involving the county feodaries.Two sets of rolls were to be compiled and engrossed - one of compositions for aids, and the other for aids \'found by inquisition\'.  These were to be prepared in duplicate, with one copy to be delivered to the collectors and the other to the Exchequer (SP 14/43, nos. 108-110).An account of the collection of the aid in the borough of Southwark states that an inquest held by way of assessment of the borough for this tax dated 30 August 1609 was sent to the collectors for their instruction.  According to that account, the aid was payable \'in crastino anno septimo [James I]\', possibly the day after the commissioners received their commission (E 179/290/46).  The money was certainly due before December 1609, when a commission was issued to compound with persons in arrears for their contributions.  A contemporary copy of the compositions made in Huntingdonshire can be found in BL, Cotton MS Cleo. F.VI, fos 317-318v, and a book of the accounts rendered by several counties exists at E 179/273/39.Although no documents relating to this aid survive among the records of series E 179 for Caernarfonshire, several letters and other documents exist in the National Library of Wales among the Wynn of Gwydir collection.  These include two copies of the instructions to levy the aid, by composition rather than by inquisition, dated 24 March 1609 (Wynn of Gwydir 495-6), letters showing that the instructions had been received by 27 April 1609 (Wynn of Gwydir 499) and that arrangements for levying the aid, with the county\'s contribution to be set at about £100, by 31 May 1609 (Wynn of Gwydir 500).  By December 1609, accusations of delays in collecting the aid on account of confused assessment, were being made (Wynn of Gwydir 512) and indeed it was only on 31 May 1613, that it could be reported that the aid money for the county had been paid to the receiver (Wynn of Gwydir 620).  Instructions for levying this aid, thought to relate to Anglesey, [1611], are in the National Library of Wales, ref. Carreglwyd Group I 1839 and another copy relating to Caernarfonshire is in the Brogyntyn MSS (Clenennau Letters and Papers) 248 (NLW Film 1034).The entire yield of the aid was £21,750, which is less than one-sixth of the amount raised by a subsidy.(Dietz, |English Public Finance, 1558-1641|, p 123; |CSP, Dom, James I|, I, p 570)enrolled account: E 359/5, rots 15-19 ",Origin  Imposed,1st: 1609 Aug 31 x Dec
378,1611 Oct 25 ,privy seal loan ,James I ,"On 25 October 1611, the king wrote a letter under his signet to the lord chancellor, lord treasurer and other members of his privy council.  Referring to the decision already taken by king and council to levy a privy seal loan, the king gave them his formal authorisation to levy the loan, and to write to and appoint the lords lieutenant of the counties as commissioners.  The privy council was also charged with writing to the collectors whom it was enjoined to choose with care.  Upon receipt of the certificates returned by the commissioners, six members of the privy council were to send a warrant to the keeper of the privy seal for the issue of the privy seal letters.  The king took pains to stress that those persons overburdened by the loan, through misinformation of the extent of their means, were to be discharged by the council.  The privy council itself was to assess the ability of wealthy persons in and around London to lend.  Another letter, signed by the king, orders lord Burghley and Sir Julius Caesar to supply the names of officers of the Exchequer from whom a loan could be procured (BL, Lansdowne MS 156, fos 74-75v, 77).A copy of the instructions sent to the lords lieutenant of the counties, which accords with the king\'s directions to the privy council, dated 31 October 1611, also survives among the papers of Sir Julius Caesar.  The instructions referred first to the usual practice of monarchs to seek loans from their subjects to supply \'those present occasions for publicque service which cannot wait for the grant and collection of a contribution by the generality of the king\'s subjects\', and then state the king\'s intention of \'borrowing from some private gentlemen and others\'.  The lieutenants were asked to collect as many names of persons as they can, \'either out of your knowledge and experience, or by any other means or instruments, which you like best\', who \'may bee of ability\' to furnish the king with sums of money.  They were to return within 20 days a book listing the names of the persons, their places of residence, and the amounts that the lieutenants thought that they could spare, so that the privy council could direct to them their privy seal letters, a copy of which was enclosed.  The lieutenants were also to make known the council\'s purpose to those of their deputies as \'from whom we have special cause to promise ourselves all good offices of dutie and affection\'.  They were not to treat with any peers, gentlemen who been made baronets, or members of the clergy for loans.  The latter were to be approached by the metropolitans of the ecclesiastical provinces, and then only those \'speciall persons\' known to be \'men of wealth and abilitie\'.  The lieutenants were also to inform those persons who had already lent money (and been repaid) that they would be asked again, but only for one-third the amounts previously lent.  Any further directions required by the commissioners were to be sought from the privy council (BL, Lansdowne MS 156, fo 79).On the following folio of  the same manuscript is a copy of the letters of appointment sent to the collectors of the loan by the Lord Treasurer and privy council, again acting on the king\'s instructions.  The collectors were to make their collection \'from time to time\' and were always to pay the money received for these loans into the Exchequer within twelve days of having received it, and not to make delays in forwarding the money, as had been made by past collectors of loans, who had at times occasioned delays of \'five, six or seven or more months\'.  Each collector, upon receipt of the privy seals, was to send a note to the clerk of the privy seal informing him of the number of letters he had received.  Should the collectors encounter any difficulty in collecting the money, they were to certify the names of defaulting persons to the Exchequer (Lansdowne MS 156, fo 80).In December 1611, privy seal letters requesting loans of between £10 and £50 began to be sent.  In that month 5,662 privy seals were despatched, and in January 1612, a further 9,705 letters were sent.  A bundle of these cancelled privy seal letters survive in E 34/57.  These form letters, printed in |civilite| type, refer to the greater sums expended by the king on \'divers publique services\', particularly for the maintenence and increase of \'magazine\' in the navy and in the king\'s forces in Ireland, and \'in building and repairing, and in making sundry provisions\', than had been spent in the last 20 years.  The fact that recent lenders had \'good experience\' of repayment was also cited, and the king\'s subjects were enjoined to lend these small sums \'which few men would deny a friend\'.  Lenders were required to pay the loan within twelve days of receipt of the letter, and were promised repayment within 18 months of payment of the loan.  Most of these privy seal letters were dated in December 1611, but others were given dates in January, February and March 1612; repayment of them took place usually in 1615 or in 1616.  One example of a second printing of this same letter (with a briefer text) in the following year is also extant (regnal year 10 James I - 1612-3), and a third printing is evidenced by eight letters bearing the partially-printed date of May 1613, all of which were repaid in 1615-7 (E 34/57; SP 14/66, nos 69, 90; SP 14/67, no 113; SP 14/68, nos 19, 57).BL, Add MS 27,877, a large folio volume of 161 folios, is a register of lenders of this loan.  The volume begins with the officers of all the king\'s courts, then lists \'merchant straingers\', before proceeding to a county-by-county listing of each lender and the date his payment was due.  As indicated in the privy seal letters, most payment dates were in December 1611, or in January or February 1612, but some were as late as June 1612.  In some cases, particularly those of the foreign merchants, the dates of repayment were entered in the left-hand margin.

379,1612 Aug 30 ,aid to marry the king\'s daughter Elizabeth ,James I ,"The privy council discussed this scheme on 3 August 1612, when preparations of the commissions and instructions to levy the aid were in hand.  By 27 August the lords had given their approval and on 30 August a warrant was sent to the chancellor to issue commissions for the levy.The instructions issued to the commissioners were virtually identical to those issued for the levy of the aid to knight Prince Henry in 1609.  The preferred method of proceeding was by composition, since gathering information on feudal tenures was considered too \'troublesome\'.  The commissioners were directed to summon juries composed of the most substantial freeholders of the area, as well as all the king\'s freeholders in every parish, and to make it known how lucky they were that the king was prepared to accept compositions based on the estimated values of their estates.  If they chose instead to be subjected to a proper investigation into feudal tenures by the county feodaries, and were charged the rates that statute law allowed the king to levy, of 20s. per knight\'s fee or 20s. for every £20 worth of land held in socage, they would end up paying much more than the king would willingly accept as a composition.The commissioners were instructed, therefore, to proceed by jury inquest and charge according to these rates, only if freeholders\' refused to make compositions, and they were to prepare two sets of duplicate assessments, accordingly.A list of commissioners appointed to levy the aid, identified as such by Richard Cust, survives in E 163/16/21.  The expected yield was treble the rate collected in 1609 for the knighting of Prince Henry (Surrey Record Office, Guildford, LM 1524; SP14/70, no 60).  The council also sent letters asking for the advancing of loans against the aid.Draft accounts of the receiver-general\'s department indicate that money received for the aid over the period 23 December 1612 to 6 February 1613 totalled £6,078 15s.2d.

380,1614 June 28 ,benevolence or \'free gift\' ,James I ,"As early as 17 February 1614, potential contributors to a benevolence were being identified, as attested by two lists of persons assessed for the last subsidy in London at £50 and more, on goods, and elsewhere in England, on lands.  Both lists were compiled and annotated by Lord Burghley (BL, Lansdowne MS 165, fos 228-233).After the dissolution of Parliament early in June 1614, letters were sent, broadcast by the king\'s council, seeking contributions.  A draft of a letter dated 28 June 1614 sent to the commissioners appointed to levy the gift states that, whereas parliament had been dissolved without granting a supply to the king, many lords, higher clergy, members of the privy council and gentlemen \'of worth and qualitie\' have given the king plate or money, or both, and spurred on by this example, the king\'s judges, gentlemen and others living in adjacent shires, and some cities and boroughs, have \'resolved to follow\' them in this action.  The commissioners were therefore to appoint persons to collect like contributions and to send them to the king\'s jewel house in Whitehall, with a written register of the value of every gift and the names of the donors, so that the king \'may be pleased to take notice of their good affections...and ever retayne [them] in his gratefull remembrance\'.  Whatever was given was to be employed only for payment of the king\'s debts, \'as namely for Ireland, the navey and the cawtionary townes in the lowe cuntreyes\' (BL, Add MS 34,324, fo 69).A contemporary copy of these same instructions, dated 4 July 1614, sent to the sheriff and justices of the peace in Kent, who were to act as commissioners there, survives among the papers of Sir Francis Fane, a privy councillor, together with the return made to Fane by the commissioners dated 1 August 1614.  A letter also dated 1 August 1614 sent to Sir Francis by the Kent commissioner John Leveson described the procedure followed by the commissioners in soliciting the contributions, and the obvious need felt for the careful handling of the king\'s subjects, as well as the debates among themselves regarding what they should contribute.  A copy follows of the notice sent by the commissioners, dated 19 September, to four men (probably constables) in the hundred of Brenchley, ordering them to assemble a list of persons before them on 1 October, when the king\'s letter would be read to them.  The more strongly worded letter of 17 September from the privy council to the commissioners, stressing the dangerous situation in the Palatinate, was also copied by Fane, as well as the report from the Kent commissioners to the privy council of the seditious speech made on 28 September at the meeting held at Maidstone to solicit contributions by a disaffected, non-conformist minister, denying the legality of the levy, as well as the council\'s alarmed reply to it of 30 September (BL, Add MS 34,218, fos 146-149).The declared account of Robert Seymour, king\'s receiver of the money and plate given to the king by the \'free gift and love of his people\', both clergy and laity, has survived.(Dietz, |English Public Finance, 1558-1641|, pp 158-159)declared account: E 351/1950 ",Origin  Imposed,1st: 1614 June
381,1621 Dec 18 or later ,spontaneous or free gift for the defence of the Palatinate ,James I ,"On 20 November 1621, Lionel Cranfield, Earl of Middlesex and Lord Treasurer of England appealed to parliament for a grant of supply for the defence of the Palatinate.  After the prorogation of parliament on 18 December without providing such funds, the council resolved to gather in a \'spontaneous\' or \'free\' gift, or benevolence, of from £100 to £200 from the leading subjects of the realm.  The benevolence began to be collected in January 1622.  It appears that subsequently this benevolence was expanded to include lesser subjects.  A roll listing persons in Nottinghamshire who had \'graunted voluntarilye to contribute by way of benevolence\' for the same cause, dated 13 May 1622, indicates that commissioners had been authorised in each county to solicit contributions and appoint collectors to gather in the sums promised.  The amounts contributed in Nottinghamshire ranged from £5 to 4s., although most \'gifts\' were of 8s. (E 179/160/284).  There are other similar lists for Leicestershire (E 179/134/287 and 314).  The original accounts for the collection made in Osgoldcross wapentake, Yorkshire, are now Bodleian Library, MS Top. Yorks. c.26, fos. 115-120.Despite protestations of poverty, the benevolence brought in £105,489 in 1622 and an additional £10,942 in 1623.(Dietz, |English Public Finance, 1558-1641|, p 194; Russell, |Parliaments and English Politics|, pp 125-126) ",Origin  Imposed,1st: 1622 Jan  - 1623 Dec
648,1620 Sept 30 ,voluntary contribution for the defence of the Palatinate ,James I ,"In August 1620 Spinola fell upon the Palatinate at the head of 24,000 troops from the Netherlands.  Initially the king was reluctant to divert his attention from his sports to consider the situation, but subsequently his mood changed.  On 24 September he remonstrated bitterly with Count Gondomar, the Spanish ambassador, and declared his intention to defend the inheritance of his \'children\' - in person, if need be - and in this temper he formally made known this intention to the council, to whom the matter was referred for deliberation.At a session of the council on 30 September, it was decided that the best means of gathering funds for this purpose would be a \'speedie Contribution\' and, as an \'incouragement to others\', they declared the sums they were prepared to contribute themselves.  Sir Albert Morton was instructed to secure the subscriptions of those who had been absent from the meeting, and a circular letter was dispatched to various prelates, nobles, and knights requesting their contributions (SP 14/118, no. 25).  It was at first reported that the response was generous, but it was also stated that some who refused to contribute were being made sheriffs or were being raised in their tax for the musters to teach them liberality.  The council, realizing the greatness of the need, had assessed particularly large sums upon leading subjects.  Each great lord was asked for £1,000, and Robert Naunton, the Secretary of State, rated himself at £200 a year for the duration of the war.  The Prince of Wales put himself down for £10,000, though it seems that only half this sum was received from him.A schedule compiled on 4 October shows that by that date only £34,211 13s. 4d. had been received, of which 10,000 marks was from the city of London (SP 14/117, no. 2).  There is a similar list of contributors dated ten days later amongst the papers of Sir Julius Caesar in the British Library (Add MS 34,324, fos 127-128v).As the initial returns were unsatisfactory, a second series of 109 letters was issued on 25 and 31 October to various lords and prelates (SP 14/117, no. 30; |Acts of the Privy Council, 1619-1621|, pp 291-3).  By 8 November 1620, reports of these had reached Caernarfonshire; \'There is speech of a new contribution for the maintenance of the Palatine\'s own country for Marquis Spindalo has taken some cities there and now aid is to be sent thither.  The bishops and clergymen begin very bountifully and many great lawyers and officers give £100 a piece and it is thought that this contribution will be as great as the former if it do not exceed it\' (National Library of Wales, Brogyntyn MSS (Clenennau Letters and Papers) 397 (NLW Film 1034)).  Despite this optimism, the response to this appeal was exceptionally poor, perhaps as a result of the abundance of crops that autumn, which left grain prices so low as to threaten a business depression.  On 15 November, Lord Cavendish replied that he was unable to make further contributions, since he had already borrowed to make the last and had only credit left.  Thomas, Lord Wentworth, responded in a letter of 7 December that he had already given as much as he could, but that he would support the granting of a supply in the next parliament.  One by one, the other great peers made their excuses (SP 14/117, nos. 75, 86, 104-110; SP 14/118, nos. 1, 13, 19, 28, 31, 32, 42-45, 52, 53, 56-59).By 6 December only £5,345 had been added (SP 14/118, no. 11).  On 13 December, the Secretary of State wrote to Sir George Calvert \'You will not thinke what a tryle we have to get in the Contribucion monies.  No Earle that is not a Counseillor will yet beginne. Some few Barons come on megrely.  We are this day put in hope to get some 4 or 5 [thousand pounds] from the City upon Friday, now that we have set them into the right way, being complexionated rather to give 5000 out of ther common stockes, then 5 out of theyr owne several purses\' (SP 14/118, no. 25).  Yet a schedule of moneys received, dated 10 January 1621, shows no addition to the city&#8217;s earlier subscription (SP 14/119, no. 14).  This document records that the total sum received to that date was £32,361 13s. 4d.

917,1606 April 2 - 9 ,four clerical subsidies ,James I ,"The southern clergy met in convocation at Westminster College (formerly Westminster Abbey) on 2 April 1606, and by 9 April 1606, when the clergy of the northern province gave their assent, had granted King James I four subsidies of 4s. in the pound each.  Among other royal expenses to which the subsidies were meant to contribute were the great and excessive charges of the funeral of the late queen.  The grant was confirmed in the parliament which sat between 5 November 1605 and 27 May 1606.The four subsidies was to be paid twice yearly in eleven payments, spread over 5 and a half years.  The first ten payments were to be levied at the rate of 1s.6d. in the pound, and the eleventh payment at 12d. in the pound.  As before, the subsidies were to be levied on income from all manner of benefices and clerical offices, and paid by every archbishop, bishop, dean, archdeacon, prebendary, provost, master of college, master of hospital, parson, vicar and all other members of the clergy enjoying any spiritual promotion or other temporal possessions annexed to the same spiritual promotions.  Parsons, vicars and other clergy whose benefices were valued at less than £6 13s. 4d. per annum were wholly exempt.  Vicars whose benefices were valued at less than £8 per annum were also wholly exempt, and vicars whose benefices were valued at between £8 and £10 per annum were to pay only 13s. 4d. per subsidy.  Only benefices worth more than £10 per annum, therefore, were to pay the full rates of 1s.6d. in the pound for the first ten payments and 12d. in the pound for the eleventh payment.The subsidies were to be levied according to the valuation made for first fruits and tenths, with deduction made for payment of the tenth part of their income, under the act of first fruits and tenths.  The clergy were to be taxed for the subsidies, therefore, on nine-tenths of their income.  No one promoted to a benefice or office, who had compounded or was to compound for payment of first fruits between 2 October 1605 and 26 March 1606 was liable to pay the first payment of the four subsidies, no one who had been promoted to a benefice or office and compounded for payment of his first fruits between 26 March 1606 and 26 March 1611 was to be charged with payment of the two payments of the subsidies next due thereafter, and no one who had been promoted to a benefice or office and compounded for payment of his first fruits from and after 26 March 1611 was to be charged with payment of the last and eleventh payment of the four subsidies.  Allowable deductions from the taxable value of new bishoprics, deaneries, cathedral or collegiate churches, or colleges, etc. were whatever portions of their revenue had been given for the maintenance of poor men, school masters, ushers, grammarians, choristers, petty canons, vicars choral, readers of divinity, singing men, vergers and other necessary and daily officers or ministers, and the expenses of rebuilding or repairing of any cathedral or collegiate churches or colleges.  These deductions were to be certified to the Exchequer, upon due search and examination by the bishop or archbishop (or by the dean and chapter, in the event of a vacant see), by 22 February each year (for subsidy payments due on the previous 2 October) and by 14 July each year (for subsidy payments due on the previous 26 March).  Any parson, vicar or other clergyman paying a pension (i.e., to stipendiary priests) which was not deducted from the assessment for his liability for these subsidies was allowed to retain for his own use the amount of it for which he was taxed.  Stipendiary priests themselves were henceforth no longer liable to pay the subsidies.Exempt from payment of the subsidies were any benefices, almshouses, hospitals or grammar schools belonging to any college within the universities of Oxford or Cambridge, the college of Westminster, to Eton College or Winchester College, any poor men, women or children living on alms in any hospitals, almshouses or alms halls, or any benefices liable to pay fifteenths or other lay subsidies.  No cathedrals, churches or other ecclesiastical places which had previously been charged with maintaining anniversaries, obits, lights, lamps etc. in chantries, which were now in the king\'s hands, were to pay any tax on any part or portion of income from such chantries to which the king was now entitled or possessed of, but were to have deduction and allowance made to them in their assessment for the subsidies accordingly.  The same was to be true of concealed lands, which had previously been in the hands of cathedrals or churches, but were no longer in their possession. Lay farmers or other lessees of forms of spiritual income were likewise liable to pay the subsidies on behalf of their landlords, unless they could produce any writings, covenants or bonds that showed otherwise.  Spiritual possessions were not subject to payment of fifteenths or other taxes granted by the laity, however.The subsidies were to be collected by the bishops and their appointees in every diocese, or by the dean and chapter in the case of a vacant see, and they were to certify the names of all deputy collectors appointed.  The subsidies were to be paid twice a year, on 2 October and 26 March, beginning on 2 October 1606 and ending on 2 October 1611.  The revenue collected each year on 2 October was to be paid into the Exchequer by the following 22 February, and that collected each year on 26 March was to be paid into the Exchequer by the following 14 July.  Each collector was to receive an acquittance upon payment of the tax money, for which he was to be charged only 4d.Collectors were empowered to compel payment of the subsidies from any defaulters by sequestration of the fruits and profits of their benefices or offices, after lawful warning given to them, to release them from any ecclesiastical censures under which they had been placed, once their payment had been received, and to revoke all process made against them.  Collectors or bishops could sell goods distrained from defaulters, remitting the money received for them to the Exchequer.  After a first refusal to pay, the defaulter was liable for the collector\'s costs in coming, going and demanding the tax, and after a second refusal, he was bound to pay the fourth part of the subsidies in addition to the amount that he had been assessed to pay.  In the event of obstinate and persistent refusal to pay, the defaulter would be deprived of his benefice or office after due warning. Collectors were to be discharged of any amounts that they certified to the Exchequer by 14 July (for payments due on 26 March) and by 22 February (for payments due on 2 October) each year that they were unable to collect from defaulters, and the form and exact wording of this certificate was specified in the subsidy act.Within four days of the collector\'s arrival at the Exchequer with the tax money, the appointed receiver was to receive the money and deliver a receipt to the collector or his deputy for every payment made.  Auditors of collectors\' accounts were to hear and audit their accounts within six days after a request to account had been made, and were to give bonds to this effect.  For every default or delay in the accounting procedure, the auditor was to be fined £10, half of which was to be paid to the collector so inconvenienced and half to the crown, upon complaint made to the treasurer, under-treasurer or chief baron of the Exchequer.  The offending auditor was to be imprisoned until paying the forfeited sum.  All acquittances given by collectors to taxpayers were to be honoured at the Exchequer, and if they were not, then the offender was to be subject to the same penalties as above specified.  Collectors were to be allowed 6d. of every pound for the charges of collection, carrying and paying in of the subsidies, and were to receive an acquittance at their final accounting each year, for which acquittance the accountant would be charged the sum of 3s.4d. to be paid to the clerk for writing it.(Wilkins, |Concilia|, IV, p 429; |Stat Realm|, IV, pp 1101-1108 (3 James I, c. 25); P.

918,1610 July 16 - 17 ,clerical subsidy ,James I ,"In the convocation that met at Westminster College (formerly Westminster Abbey) on 16 July 1610, the clergy of the southern province granted the king a subsidy of 6s. in the pound, and on 17 July 1610 the clergy of the northern province gave their assent to the grant.  Among the reasons given for the grant were \'popish mutinies and attempts to overthrowe of the true religion\'.  It was confirmed in the parliament that sat from 9 February to 23 July 1610.The subsidy was to be paid in four payments, spread over two years.  The first two payments were to be levied at 1s. in the pound each, the third payment was at 1s. 6d. in the pound and the fourth payment was at the rate of 2s. 6d. in the pound.

919,1622 Jan 21 ,clerical voluntary contribution ,James I ,"On 14 January 1622, James I wrote to the archbishop of Canterbury and bishop of Lincoln. Making reference to his efforts to recover the patrimony of his children in Germany, then withheld from them by force, he asked for the grant of a voluntary contribution from the clergy. The latter, he noted, had promised him a grant \'to the proportion of one subsidy\' at their last meeting before Christmas, but \'the same failing to be legally perfected by the wayward divisions of some few\'. He was now constrained, therefore, \'to try the dutiful affections of our subjects in another way, as our predecessors have done in former times, by propounding a voluntary contribution unto them\'.They were to give notice to the other bishops who had not yet left London, and together with them, write letters to all the bishops of both provinces, \'for the speedy collecting, and receiving of the voluntary contributions of the whole clergy\'. They were also to write to all the schoolmasters licensed to teach within their respective dioceses, and ask similarly for their contributions.Having met to consider the king\'s request, the archbishop of Canterbury and the bishops of Lincoln, London, Durham, Winchester, Worcester, Rochester, Coventry and Lichfield, Bath and Wells, Bangor, Ely, Landaff, St. David\'s and Chester decided that they would grant the king a contribution of 3s.10d. in the pound, presumably from the income of all clergy, to include also all lecturers and schoolmasters. The contribution was to be collected and paid into the hands of appointed receivers in London by 10 March 1622.  The bishops were to send the archbishop of Canterbury the names of all clergy who contributed and the sums that they gave.A list of the total amounts received in each diocese, dated 11 September 1622, survives among the State Papers, which indicates that £14,708 10s.10d. had been received in all by that date (SP 14/133, no. 17).(Wilkins, |Concilia|, IV, p 464; |CSP, Dom, James I, 1619-1623|, p 446) ",Origin  Imposed,

The grant was confirmed in the parliament which was convened on 16 January, was prorogued twice and then sat from 30 January to 4 June 1621.  It received the royal assent on 22 March 1621.The first whole subsidy was to be paid in one instalment, on 1 May 1621, and the other two were to be levied in two annual payments of 2s. in the pound each, on 1 November and 1 May, beginning on 1 November 1621 and ending on 1 May 1623 (E 179/2/94; E 179/10/138; E 179/23/154).Unfortunately, James I dissolved parliament before the statute roll was drawn up and the text of the tax grant does not appear to survive among either the crown records or convocation act books.  An index to the lost convocation act book of Canterbury province (now Bodl., Libr., MS Tanner 282, f. 27v), and a summary entry in the Borthwick Institute, York Convocation Act Book, vol.

The provisions of the lost subsidy act were no doubt very similar, (|mutatis mutandis|), if not identical, to those of 1610 and 1624.An assessment of the benefices in the dioceses of Gloucester, Bristol and Oxford for tenths and for these subsidies is now E 179/67/70.  A list of the total receipts in each diocese for the first subsidy, dated 11 September 1622, indicates that the subsidy yield was £18,780. 5s. 7d.

921,1624 April 30 - May 13 ,four clerical subsidies ,James I ,"In April 1624, during a period of anti-Catholic fervour, in meetings of both parliament and convocation immediate action by the king against Jesuits and seminary priests was demanded.  As soon as the king agreed to issue a proclamation expelling all Catholic clergy from the realm, a convocation of the clergy at Westminster College (formerly Westminster Abbey) on 30 April 1624 granted the king four subsidies of 4s. in the pound, to be paid over three and a half years.  The clergy of the northern province gave their assent to this grant on 13 May 1624.  The hasty generosity of the clergy was not universally welcome in the Commons, but the grant was confirmed by parliament during the session that sat from 19 February to 29 May 1624.The subsidies were to be paid in seven instalments over three and a half years.  The first whole subsidy of 4s. in the pound was payable in one instalment, and the other three subsidies were to be collected twice annually (at 2s. in the pound) in the following three years.  As before, the subsidy was to be levied on income from all manner of benefices and clerical offices, and paid by every archbishop, bishop, dean, archdeacon, prebendary, provost, master of college, master of hospital, parson, vicar and all other members of the clergy enjoying any spiritual promotion or other temporal possessions annexed to the same spiritual promotions.  Parsons, vicars and other clergy whose benefices were valued at less than £6 13s. 4d. per annum were wholly exempt.  Vicars whose benefices were valued at less than £8 per annum were also wholly exempt, and vicars whose benefices were valued at between £8 and £10 per annum were to pay only 13s. 4d. for the first whole subsidy and 8d. for every payment of the other three subsidies. Only benefices worth more than £10 per annum, therefore, were to pay the full rates.The subsidy was to be levied according to the valuation made for first fruits and tenths, with deduction made for payment of the tenth part of their income, under the act of first fruits and tenths.  The clergy were to be taxed for the subsidy, therefore, on nine-tenths of their income.  No one promoted to a benefice or office, who had compounded or was to compound for payment of first fruits between 1 June 1623 and 1 June 1624 was liable to pay the first subsidy, no one who had been promoted to a benefice or office and compounded for payment of his first fruits between 1 June 1624 and 1 June 1627 was to be charged with payment of any of the other three subsidies for the first year after his promotion.  Allowable deductions from the taxable value of new bishoprics, deaneries, cathedral or collegiate churches, or colleges, etc. were whatever portions of their revenue had been given for the maintenance of poor men, school masters, ushers, grammarians, choristers, petty canons, vicars choral, readers of divinity, singing men, vergers and other necessary and daily officers or ministers, and the expenses of rebuilding or repairing of any cathedral or collegiate churches or colleges.  These deductions were to be certified to the Exchequer, upon due search and examination by the bishop or archbishop (or by the dean and chapter, in the event of a vacant see), by 31 August each year (for subsidy payments due on the previous 1 June) and by 28 February each year (for subsidy payments due on the previous 1 December).Exempt from payment of the subsidies were any benefices, almshouses, hospitals or grammar schools belonging to any college within the universities of Oxford or Cambridge, the college of Westminster, to Eton College or Winchester College.  No cathedrals, churches or other ecclesiastical places which had previously been charged with maintaining anniversaries, obits, lights, lamps etc. in chantries, which were now in the king\'s hands, were to pay any tax on any part or portion of income from such chantries to which the king was now entitled or possessed of, but were to have deduction and allowance made to them in their assessment for the subsidies accordingly.  The same was to be true of concealed lands, which had previously been in the hands of cathedrals or churches, but were no longer in their possession. Lay farmers or other lessees of forms of spiritual income were likewise liable to pay the subsidies on behalf of their landlords, unless they could produce any writings, covenants or bonds that showed otherwise.  Spiritual possessions were not subject to payment of fifteenths or other taxes granted by the laity, however.  As before, stipendiary priests do not appear to have been liable to pay the subsidy.The subsidy was to be collected by the bishops and their appointees in every diocese, or by the dean and chapter in the case of a vacant see, and they were to certify the names of all deputy collectors appointed.  The first whole subsidy was payable on 1 June 1624, and the other three subsidies were to be paid twice yearly on 1 December and 1 June, beginning on 1 December 1624 and ending on 1 June 1627.  The revenue collected each year on 1 June was to be paid into the Exchequer by the following 31 August, and that collected each year on 1 December was to be paid into the Exchequer by the following 28 February.  Each collector was to receive an acquittance upon payment of the tax money, for which he was to be charged only 4d.Collectors were empowered to compel payment of the subsidies from any defaulters by sequestration of the fruits and profits of their benefices or offices, after lawful warning given to them, to release them from any ecclesiastical censures under which they had been placed, once their payment had been received, and to revoke all process made against them.  Collectors or bishops could sell goods distrained from defaulters, remitting the money received for them to the Exchequer.  After a first refusal to pay, the defaulter was liable for the collector\'s costs in coming, going and demanding the tax, and after a second refusal, he was bound to pay the fourth part of the subsidies in addition to the amount that he had been assessed to pay.  In the event of obstinate and persistent refusal to pay, the defaulter would forfeit one year\'s profits of his benefice or office, 50 days after due warning. Collectors were to be discharged of any amounts that they certified to the Exchequer by 31 August (for payments due on 1 June) and by 28 February (for payments due on 1 December) each year that they were unable to collect from defaulters, and the form and exact wording of this certificate was specified in the subsidy act.Within four days of the collector\'s arrival at the Exchequer with the tax money, the appointed receiver was to receive the money and deliver a receipt to the collector or his deputy for every payment made.  Auditors of collectors\' accounts were to hear and audit their accounts within six days after a request to account had been made, and were to give bonds to this effect.  For every default or delay in the accounting procedure, the auditor was to be fined £10, half of which was to be paid to the collector so inconvenienced and half to the crown, upon complaint made to the treasurer, under-treasurer or chief baron of the Exchequer.  The offending auditor was to be imprisoned until paying the forfeited sum.  All acquittances given by collectors to taxpayers were to be honoured at the Exchequer, and if they were not, then the offender was to be subject to the same penalties as above specified.  Collectors were to be allowed 6d. of every pound for the charges of collection, carrying and paying in of the subsidies, and were to receive an acquittance at their final accounting each year, for which acquittance the accountant would be charged the sum of 3s.4d. to be paid to the clerk for writing it.(Wilkins, |Concilia|, IV, pp 468-469; |Stat Realm|, IV, pp 1263-1269 (21 James I, c. 34); P.

14,1200 Feb 27 - April 28 ,carucage of 3s. ,John ,"This further carucage resulted from King John&#8217;s need to pay 20,000 marks (recorded as 30,000 marks by several chroniclers), agreed at the treaty of Le Goulet in January 1200, to Philip II as a relief for his lands in France.  It was imposed by the king during a visit to England from Normandy, which lasted from 27 February to 28 April 1200, and was at a rate of 3s.  According to the Coggeshall chronicle, John paid his debt to Philip after his return to France.Perhaps as a result of the shortcomings of the levy of 1198, this one was based on a different unit, the plough team itself.  This is indicated by the contents of an assessment schedule of the estates of Abingdon abbey (E 179/73/1A).  The archbishop of York and the Cistercians both opposed the tax, but were unable to overcome the king&#8217;s will.  The bishop of Exeter and the abbots of Furness and St Albans managed to avoid a full assessment of their plough teams by making a fine, and the men of Kesteven and Holland in Lincolnshire again fined to have their ancient assessment, as they had in 1194.  A large return for Lincolnshire which seems to be for this tax survives (E 179/242/113), although it is possible that it belongs to the carucage of 1198.(Howden, |Chronica|, IV, p 107, 140; Coggeshall, |Chronicon Anglicanum|, pp 101-110; |Annales Monastici|, ed.

An order for the collection of the scutage was issued on 1 September, and payment was due by 29 September.In connection with this expedition a tallage was raised, as were |dona| from religious houses.  The latter were demanded before 20 June.Recent analysis of John\'s revenue gives a total of over £2,700 yielded by this scutage, over £2,000 of which was received in 1199, the remainder being paid the following year.See S K Mitchell, |Studies in Taxation under John and Henry III| (London, 1914), pp 21-32; Helena M Chew, \'Scutages and Aids in England, particularly in the Fourteenth Century\' (unpublished MA thesis, London, 1921), p 51; Nick Barratt, \'The Revenue of King John\', |EHR|, CXI (1996), pp 835-855, tables 4, 5.1.

38,1203 June ,seventh on moveables of earls and barons ,John ,"According to the chronicle of Roger of Wendover, in December 1203 King John on his return to England imposed a tax of a seventh on moveables on the earls and barons for allegedly deserting him in Normandy, a tax in effect made as a punishment.  He says that Geoffrey fitz Peter, the justiciar, and Hubert Walter, the archbishop of Canterbury and chancellor, were responsible for its assessment and collection, from laymen and clergy respectively, and that they spared no man.  His account tends to be supported in some respects by references in a Chancery roll made in June and July 1203 and in the pipe roll for Michaelmas 1204, although the former show that the tax must have been demanded well before December 1203.  Information about the tax is sparse because it was never accounted for at the Exchequer.  It is at least clear that it was paid by the count of Aumale and William Longchamp, while the earl Marshal was acquitted.  As late as 1210 William de Berton accounted for £100 &#8216;for concealing the seventh&#8217;.  Later in 1203, on 13 August when he was at Alencon, the king requested the laity and clergy in Jersey and Guernsey to give him a fifth of their revenues for a year, in fee or alms, to provide for the defence of the islands by knights and sergeants.  It was also at about this time that a tax on merchants at a rate of a fifteenth, but with detailed exemptions, was first being collected, the earliest account beginning at 20 July 1202, but it was clearly intended to be an annual levy.  Letters patent regulating the incidence of the tax and providing for its collection were issued on 4 June 1204.(Roger of Wendover, |Flores Historiarum|, ed H G Hewlett (3 vols, Rolls Series, 1886-89), I, pp 318-19; |Rotuli de Liberate et de Misis ac Praestitis|, ed T D Hardy (Record Commission, 1844), pp 43, 47; |Pipe Roll 5 John|, Pipe Roll Society, New Series XVI (1938), pp xii-xiii, 11-12; |Pipe Roll 6 John|, Pipe Roll Society, NS XVIII (1940), pp xl-xlv, 218-20, 256; |Pipe Roll 12 John|, Pipe Roll Society, NS XXVI (1951), pp xl-xli, 192;  |Rotuli Litterarum Patentium|, ed T D Hardy (Rolls Series, 1835), pp 42, 72; |Rotuli Litterarum Clausarum|, ed T D Hardy (2 vols, Record Commission, 1833-44), I, p 84; |Rotuli de Oblatis et Finibus|, p 413; Mitchell, |Studies in Taxation|, pp 62-3; Mitchell, |Taxation in Medieval England|, pp 16-17, 29-30, 133-4; S Painter, |The Reign of King John| (1949), pp 130-31) ", ,
39,1204 Jan 2 or later ,scutage ,John ,"In 1204 the host was summoned to Portsmouth but was not dispatched, only a small picked force being sent.  John himself did not go either.At a great council which met at Oxford on 2 January 1204, it was decided to levy a scutage at 2.5 marks per fee to cover the cost of hiring mercenaries abroad.  It is said to have been |granted| but Mitchell suggests that this probably only means that the lords agreed to an increase in the rate and that the levy could be put in charge before the host was summoned.   Harriss (p 28) agrees that it was exceptional for a scutage to be granted.  Fines were also raised: generally, tenants-in-chief paid either fines (in advance) or scutage (in arrears).  Exchequer accounts for 1204 show receipts of £4,046 in scutage.(S K Mitchell, |Studies in Taxation under John and Henry III| (London, 1914), pp 63-68; Helena M Chew, \'Scutages and Aids in England, particularly in the Fourteenth Century\' (unpublished MA thesis, London, 1921), pp 52-54; Nick Barratt, \'The Revenue of King John\', |EHR|, CXI (1996), pp 835-855, table 4; G L Harriss, |King, Parliament and Public Finance in Medieval England to 1369| (Oxford, 1975), pp 11, 28).

40,1207 Feb 9 ,thirteenth on the laity and the clergy ,John ,"King John spent most of 1207 in England, having returned from the continent on 12 December 1206.  He was greatly in need of money to help his attempt to recover his lost lands in Normandy and its appendages.  Much of his income since his accession had been raised by scutages, of which there were seven between 1199 and 1206, but there was to be none in 1207.  At a council in London on 8 January John unsuccessfully asked the senior clergy to allow to let those clergy holding benefices to give him a fixed sum of their revenues, and was again rebuffed by them at another meeting at Oxford ending on 9 February.  However, it did agree to a levy on personal property and revenues, and on 17 February a writ was issued at Northampton levying a tax of a shilling in the mark on rents and moveables of laymen, to recover the king&#8217;s inheritance in Normandy and in his other lands, payable by &#8216;every layman throughout England of whatever fee he be&#8217;, and those trying to avoid payment were to be imprisoned and their possessions seized.  It was in fact also paid by the clergy, as recorded payments and the comments of many chroniclers and annalists make clear; only the Cistercians and the Hospitallers were exempt.  A number of documents refer to the tax as &#8216;the aid provided for by the council at Oxford&#8217;.The assessment of the tax was made by specially commissioned justices, charged with visiting every hundred and parish.  The names of sixteen who visited Lincolnshire and six who visited Gloucestershire are known, and were overwhelmingly local men.  Every man had to swear as to the value of his rents and moveables before the justices, except for earls and barons, who did so through their stewards and bailiffs.  Rolls were made up in duplicate, one copy being given to the sheriff, the other being kept by the assessors to deliver into the Exchequer.  There is no reference to particular kinds of goods and revenue which were to be included in the assessment, or any which were exempted.  By May much of the assessment was completed.  There are no overall accounts for the tax, which was collected by a separate &#8216;Exchequer of the Thirteenth&#8217;, but miscellaneous references to it occur in the pipe roll of the main Exchequer for Michaelmas 1207, where it is referred to as the &#8216;aid that is now assessed, that is of 12d. in the mark&#8217; or simply &#8216;the thirteenth&#8217;.  Some individuals, including the bishops of Bath and Durham, compounded instead of being properly assessed.  No deadline date is recorded for the collection of the tax, but it was evidently well in hand by April at least, and some was reported as having been collected by May.  It caused some opposition and attempts at evasion.  The archbishop of York went into voluntary exile; in April the religious in Lincolnshire were thought by the government to have concealed money collected for the thirteenth in the county; the abbots of Selby and Furness angered the king by initially refusing to pay; at least three men were actually imprisoned; and the assessment in Warwickshire had to be repeated by new commissioners at the end of May.  A note in the fine roll states that the sum raised was £57,421 11s 5d, including the fines of the religious and the compounding fines of the bishops, with only £2,615 5s 10d outstanding, excepting the debts of the sheriffs of Sussex and Cumberland, who had not yet accounted, and other unspecified items.(|Rotuli Litterarum Clausarum|, I, pp  70, 79, 81, 82, 84-86; |Rotuli Litterarum Patentium|, pp 71-3, 77, 82; |Rotuli de Oblatis et Finibus|, pp 372, 374, 395, 413, 459; |Annales Monastici|, II, pp 79, 258-9; III, p 29; |Pipe Roll 9 John|, Pipe Roll Society, NS XXII (1944), pp xviii-xxi, 13, 14, 29, 35, 47, 63, 70, 71; Mitchell, |Studies in Taxation|, pp 84-92); |Councils and Synods, A.D. 1205-1313|, II, ed.

Some towns compounded: elsewhere, individual assessments were made and copies sent in to the Exchequer.

The army assembled at Portsmouth, but apart from a small number of greater barons and knights, was sent home.  Mitchell seems to have confused the collection of the fines not to serve, which were collected in advance of a campaign, with the collection of genuine scutage, which was imposed retrospectively once the costs of the campaign were known.  (Those who paid fines were not usually compelled to pay scutage also at this date.)  He states that the scutage itself was being collected by 5 May, but his reference relates to the collection of fines, not genuine scutage: Chew gives the rate levied as 2 marks per fee, and her analysis suggests that the scutage itself was not levied until later. Exchequer accounts show a sum of £3,574 raised in scutage in 1201.(S K Mitchell, |Studies in Taxation under John and Henry III|, (London, 1914), pp 34-46; Helena M Chew, \'Scutages and Aids in England, particularly in the Fourteenth Century\' (unpublished MA thesis, London, 1921), pp 51-54; Nick Barratt, \'The Revenue of King John\', |EHR|, CXI (1996), pp 835-855, table 5.1).

The clergy paid it on their spiritualities by order of the pope; bishops were in charge of collecting from the clergy in their dioceses.  The king granted a fortieth of the revenues of his demesne, escheats, wardships and lands in hand; and asked the earls, barons, knights and freemen to contribute.  The first three named were to pay a fortieth of the annual value of each vill held by them, based on a estimate of what it would yield if farmed.  Freemen were to pay a fortieth of the annual rent they owed their lords.  Each calculated his own contribution and the sheriffs appointed \'discreet and legal men\' to collect.  A roll was drawn up by collectors, arranged by vills, containing names of contributors and the amounts paid by each.  The royal demesne was enrolled separately.This \'experiment in taxation\' - a fractional tax on revenue -should be noted; such taxes were later to become the standard form of medieval taxation (S K Mitchell, |Studies in Taxation under John and Henry III| (London, 1914), pp 45-46).

The Northern barons in particular were opposed to this levy, claiming both before the expedition and afterwards when the scutage was imposed, that service in France was not owed and that to demand it was illegal.  No fines were taken.  This scutage was signally unsuccessful: only about one sixth of the amount charged was actually paid, and the tallage of the same year was much more successful.(S K Mitchell, |Studies in Taxation under John and Henry III| (London, 1914), pp 109-116; Helena M Chew, \'Scutages and Aids in England, particularly in the Fourteenth Century\' (unpublished MA thesis, London, 1921); Nick Barratt, \'The Revenue of King John\', |EHR|, CXI (1996), pp 835-855).

683,c. 1199 Dec 31 ,papal fortieth ,John ,"Pope Innocent III imposed the first papal income tax in the last few days of 1199, when he ordered the clergy to pay a fortieth of their yearly revenues to aid the Holy Land.  The assessment and collection of the tax were entrusted to the bishops of each province, who were directed to meet for discussion of the mandate and hold immediately thereafter diocesan synods.  Each clerk was to declare the value of his income at the synods, and within the following three months, deliver the fortieth at a designated place within the diocese, to be attested by the bishop, and some monks and laymen. Those who complied with these conditions were to receive a rebate of a quarter of their enjoined penances; those who did not would answer for it before God.  The bishops and his assistants do not appear to have had any power to revise the assessments, if necessary, nor were they asked to provide any verification of the accuracy of the assessment, and the pope evidently relied on the taxpayer\'s conscience.This trust would appear to have been misplaced.  The reluctance of the English clergy to pay is implied by Innocent III\'s appointment of a papal nuncio, Master Philip, the notary, who arrived in England by 24 April 1200 to supervise the collection of the fortieth, probably bearing with him the papal mandate.  Payments were still being made in 1201 and in May of that year the pope renewed his orders to the English bishops.There do not appear to have been any accounts kept of receipts of the tax money.  The pope required only a report of the total sum received in each diocese.  The collection was evidently slow in coming, and letters written from the pope to the bishops of Ely and Norwich in 1206-7 allege, moreover, that some of the tax money collected was still being retained by these bishops; they were ordered to deposit it in the Temple in London for safe-keeping until further notice.It is not known what the total tax yield was.(W E Lunt, \'Early Assessments for Papal Taxation of English Clerical Incomes\', |Annual Report of the American Historical Association|, 1917 (Washington, 1920), pp 267-280; C R Cheney, \'Master Philip the Notary and the Fortieth of 1199\', |EHR|, LXIII (1948), pp 342-350; W E Lunt, |Financial Relations of the Papacy with England to 1327| (New York, 1939), pp 240-242) ",Origin  Imposed,1st: 1200 Mar 31

Its purpose was two-fold: to prepare a new crusade against the infidel and to plan reforms of the universal Church.  Attended by several English bishops, the council imposed a tax of a twentieth upon clerical incomes to last for three years, giving the pope the power to decide the terms of the levy.  He began the arrangements for assessment and collection of the tax before his death on 16 July 1216, but it was left to his successor Honorius III to appoint collectors and put the machinery of collection into motion.  According to the instructions sent to the province of Gran, Hungary, each clerk was required to come before the assessors and collectors and declare the amount of his income, both fixed and casual, with excommunication laid down as the penalty for making a fraudulent statement.Whether the same form of assessment was used in England, where the assessment was not made until 1217, is not known.  At Dunstable Priory, the valuation was made in that year \'secundum communem aestimationem bonorum virorum\' (|Annales Monastici|, III?, p 52).

The rates to be levied annually were exactly the same as those to have been charged in the levy of the subsidy which was cancelled at the accession of Queen Mary.Two sliding scales of rates, each with a different minimum taxable threshold, were charged annually on moveable goods - one for native-born individuals and another for foreigners.  These rates were:|Natives|£5-10               =     8d.£10-20             =    12d.£20 and more   =    16d.|Aliens|under £5          =      8d.£5-10              =    12d.£10-20            =    18d.£20 and more  =      2s.On lands, the minimum threshold of liability was 20s. per annum, on which the annual tax payable was 2s. per pound for natives, and 3s. per pound for aliens.  Aliens who were not liable in either category were charged a poll tax of 4d. each year.The first payment was to be assessed by 5 January 1556, certified at the Exchequer by 1 February 1556 and paid by 1 March 1556.  The second was to be assessed by 10 March 1557, certified by 6 April 1557 and paid by 20 May 1557.Provision was made in the Act for Wales (excluding Monmouthshire) and Cheshire regarding payment towards the subsidy and payment of mises.  The first collection of the subsidy was to be made by 1 March following the last instalment of the mise, and the second collection was to be paid by 20 May in the subsequent year.  The date of the final payment of the mise was to be certified in the Exchequer by 24 May 1556.  Surviving Welsh documents show that whereas payments in Monmouthshire were made on time as expected, those for other counties where the mise was in force were subject to considerable delay, until as late as 1561 in parts of Brecknockshire and 1566 in parts of Anglesey.A roll containing a form of writ to commissioners, dated 12 March 1558, to collect the second payment in Wales (excluding Monmouthshire) including the town of Haverfordwest is at TNA: PRO C 212/22/1.In addition to the returned assessments in the E 179 class of documents, a paper book containing the assessment for the levy of the second payment in the hundreds of Bosmere and Claydon in Suffolk is now BL, Add MS 21,037.An acquittance of the collector to Sir Rees Mansell dated 30 May 1557, presumably relating to Glamorgan and to the second collection of this subsidy is in the National Library of Wales, ref.

All natives with goods worth £5 or more, were taxed on moveable goods at a rate of 2s.8d. per pound, and aliens were to pay 5s.4d. per pound.

In September 1557, commissioners were appointed in each county to make assessments of both laymen and clerics.  They were to gather information and take note of the names of all likely lenders, and were also provided with copies of the subsidy books of the last subsidy.  Having decided whom to approach for loans, the commissioners were to divide themselves into smaller groups and treat with the individuals identified as having at least £10 in lands or goods, who were to be asked to lend sums between £20 and 100 marks, but no more.  Those who agreed to lend were to have their names and the sums promised recorded in a book, which was to be sent to the privy council in October 1557.  Upon such certification, privy seal letters were to be written out, and, upon payment of the money, despatched to the lenders.  This letter would act as their warrant for repayment, which was to be made by Christmas 1558.  One such privy seal letter, dated 17 September 1557, survives in E 34/4.  The recipient, one George Fryth, paid his loan on 18 December 1557.Those persons who refused to loan the money asked of them were to be ordered to appear before all the commissioners.  If, after this interview, they still refused, the commissioners were to take bonds of them for appearance before the council (SP11/11, nos 44-49).Collectors were appointed by the council in September 1557; a schedule of their names appears in SP11/11, no 50 and a copy of a signet letter dated 28 September 1557 appointing a collector of royal loans in Caernarfonshire, containing the instructions to collect the Privy Seal loan, is in the National Library of Wales, ref.

Lenders were given privy seal letters for repayment, one of which survives in BL, Cotton Cleo., F.VI, f. 299.  They were to be repaid within a month of All Saints Day 1557 (i.e., by 1 December).  In the following year it proved necessary to impose another loan in order to repay the loan of 1556.A book containing the names of persons who loaned Queen Mary £100 each and were later repaid, as well as persons identified as potential lenders in 1562, is in E 34/4.  Another book, now bound into a larger manuscript, headed \'the lone of £100 received by Sir Robert Rochester\', and endorsed \'A lone of money made severally to Queene Mary\', is probably also a register of persons who lent £100, or were sent privy seal letters asking for the loan.  The book groups the lenders by county, listing also the collectors.  The first entry - the mayor and aldermen of London - is followed by the amount of £6,000, but no other loans from Londoners are recorded there (BL, Harl MS 309, fos 89-94).Proceedings against those to whom letters of privy seal had been sent, but who refused to lend the required sums can be found in the |Acts of the Privy Council|, VI, and have been printed in |The Tudor Constitution|, ed.

This act repealed the arms clauses of all previous statutes, and established in their place a county militia system.  Under this act, two graduated scales were laid down for the numbers of horses, armour and weapons which \'every nobleman, gentleman and other temporal persons\' was to \'have and kepe in readines\', and maintain at his own cost and expense.  One scale was based on landed income and the other on personal estates and annuities.  There were ten levels of income derived from land, ranging from £5-10 to £1,000 per annum and above, and seven categories of personal wealth, ranging from £10-20 to 1,000 marks and above.  All laymen in receipt of annuities of at least £30 were also subject to the scale of charges which applied to personal wealth.  Anyone who was required to keep a horse by the statute of 33 Henry VIII, cc 5 &amp; 6, and who was not liable under the above terms, was to obliged to keep and maintain a horse or gelding for a light horseman, together with harness and weaponry.The act took effect on 1 May 1558, and various penalties were set out for non-compliance.  Justices of the peace in each county had authority to inquire into neglect, and were to be periodically appointed as commissioners to monitor the keeping of harness and weapons.  Clauses of the act also dealt with various contingencies, such as inability to procure the required arms, or for replacement of armour lost or horses killed.  The act expressly stated that it had no effect on the statute of 33 Hen. VIII c 9 for keeping longbows.The act was unpopular and not very effective, since no power to assess was conferred by the statute, nor any procedure for assessment.  Commissioners were totally reliant on the subsidy books for information, with all the disadvantages incumbent upon this system of measuring wealth, such as chronic under-assessment and the fact that landowners were charged only in their parish of residence.The statute was to remain in effect, however, until its repeal in 1604, after the accession of James I.  It was not replaced by any other and the management of the militia was administered by the lords lieutenants under instructions from the council.  Not until the period of Civil War was the issue of a county militia dealt with effectively.(|Stat.

674,1555 Dec 2 ,clerical subsidy ,Philip and Mary ,"The grant of a subsidy by the clergy of the provinces of Canterbury and York was confirmed in the parliament which began on 21 October 1555.  The subsidy act was passed in the Commons on 2 December 1555.  The subsidy granted was the familiar 6s. in the pound, to be collected over three years, at the rate of 2s. in the pound each year.Its provisions were much the same as those of the subsidies granted in the reigns of Henry VIII and Edward VI, but with a few modifications.  As before, the tax of 2s. in the pound per annum was on income from all manner of benefices and clerical offices, and was to be paid by every archbishop, bishop, dean, archdeacon, prebendary, provost, master of college, master of hospital, parson, vicar and all other members of the clergy enjoying any spiritual promotion or other temporal possessions annexed to the same spiritual promotions.  As before, parsons and vicars whose benefices were valued at more than £5 but no more than £6 13s. 4d. per annum were to pay only 6s.8d. per annum, and all parsons and vicars whose benefices were worth £5 per annum or less were wholly exempt from paying the subsidy.The subsidy was to be levied according to the valuation made for first fruits and tenths, that is, the |Valor Ecclesiasticus| made in 1535, with deduction made for payment of the tenth part of their income, under the act of first fruits and tenths (now repealed).  They were to be taxed for the subsidy, therefore, on nine-tenths of their income, and the newer bishoprics and deaneries were to pay the subsidy according to the valuations made in 1543.  Allowable deductions from the taxable value of these new bishoprics, deaneries etc. were whatever portions of their revenue had been given for the maintenance of \'poore men, gramarions, queresters, students and other officers and ministers not to be charged with any part of this subsidie\'.As before, exempt from payment of the subsidy were any benefices, almshouses, hospitals or grammar schools belonging to any college within the universities of Oxford or Cambridge, or to Eton College or Winchester College, or any benefices liable to pay fifteenths or other lay subsidies.Any clergy in receipt of a pension of 40s. per annum or less as a result of the dissolution of the monasteries, hospitals, colleges, chantries, fraternities, guilds or other incorporations was, however, liable to pay the subsidy on the income of his/her pension.  Anyone else liable to pay the subsidy who was also charged with paying pensions to the ex-religious were to be allowed to retain the 2s. in the pound in each of the three years, to his own relief.  Lay farmers or other lessees of forms of spiritual income were likewise liable to pay the subsidy on behalf of their landlords, unless they could produce any writings, covenants or bonds that showed otherwise.  Spiritual possessions were not subject to payment of fifteenths or other taxes granted by the laity, however.  A new provision of this subsidy was the introduction of graduated rates to be paid by stipendiary clergy.  Unbeneficed clergy in receipt of an annual stipend of £8 or less were to pay a flat rate of 6s.8d. per annum in each of the three years, those receiving an annual stipend of more than £8 up to £10 were to pay 10s. each year, those receiving an annual stipend of more than £10 up to 20 marks were to pay 13s. 4d. each year, and those receiving an annual stipend of more than 20 marks were to pay 2s. in the pound each year, just as beneficed clergy.  The subsidy was to be collected by the bishops and their appointees in every diocese, or by the dean and chapter in the case of a vacant see.  The subsidy was to be collected in one annual payment on 1 October each year, and paid into the Exchequer by the following 31 January.  Collectors were empowered to compel payment of the subsidy from any defaulters by sequestration of the fruits and profits of their benefices or offices, after lawful warning given to them, and to release them from any ecclesiastical censures under which they had been placed, once their payment had been received, and revoke all process made against them.  After a first refusal to pay, the defaulter was liable for the collector\'s costs in coming, going and demanding the tax, and after a second refusal, he was bound to pay the fourth part of the subsidy in addition to the amount that he had been assessed to pay.  In the event of obstinate and persistent refusal to pay, the defaulter would be deprived of his benefice or office 30 days after due warning.  Collectors were to account at the Exchequer, and were to be allowed 6d. of every pound for the charges of collection, carrying and paying in of the subsidy, and were to receive an acquittance when accounting, for which acquittance the accountant would be charged the sum of 2d. per acquittance.Another new provision took account of changing circumstances since the valuations of 1535 and 1543.  It was ordained that if there were any unpaid arrears at the end of the three years of the subsidy because of any decay or loss of benefices liable to pay the subsidy, it would be allowed to every bishop to re-assess the subsidy in their diocese, re-apportioning the outstanding amount accordingly.  These \'arrears\' were to be collected in the following year, on the same dates and under the same terms as the three payments of the subsidy (i.e., collected on 1 October 1559 and paid into the Exchequer by 31 January 1560).  A record of payments and arrears in the diocese of Canterbury, to 1 October 1558, is now Lambeth Palace Library, CM I/60/1. (|Stat Realm|, IV, pp 297-300 (2 &amp; 3 Philip &amp; Mary, c. 22); P.R.N.

904,1558 March 7 or earlier ,clerical subsidy ,Philip and Mary ,"England went to war against France in the spring of 1557.  Accordingly, early in February 1558, the clergy of Canterbury province met in convocation and approved a new clerical subsidy even though the final instalment of the previous subsidy would not fall due until 1 October 1558.  The text of the Canterbury grant was sent to the archbishop of York and the northern clergy made a similar grant.  These grants were confirmed in the first session of the parliament which began on 20 January 1558 and ended on 7 March 1558.The grant was for 8s. in the pound, payable over four years, but its provisions were otherwise identical to those of the subsidy granted in 1555.  As before, the tax of 2s. in the pound per annum was on income from all manner of benefices and clerical offices, and was to be paid by every archbishop, bishop, dean, archdeacon, prebendary, provost, master of college, master of hospital, parson, vicar and all other members of the clergy enjoying any spiritual promotion or other temporal possessions annexed to the same spiritual promotions.  Parsons and vicars whose benefices were valued at more than £5 but no more than £6 13s. 4d. per annum were to pay only 6s.8d. per annum, and all parsons and vicars whose benefices were worth £5 per annum or less were wholly exempt from paying the subsidy.The subsidy was to be levied according to the valuation made for first fruits and tenths, with deduction made for payment of the tenth part of their income, under the act of first fruits and tenths (now repealed).  They were to be taxed for the subsidy, therefore, on nine-tenths of their income.  Allowable deductions from the taxable value of new bishoprics, deaneries etc. were whatever portions of their revenue had been given for the maintenance of poor men, school masters, ushers, grammarians, choristers and other officers and ministers.Exempt from payment of the subsidy were any benefices, almshouses, hospitals or grammar schools belonging to any college within the universities of Oxford or Cambridge, or to Eton College or Winchester College, any poor men, women or children living on alms in any hospitals, almshouses or alms halls, or any benefices liable to pay fifteenths or other lay subsidies.Any clergy in receipt of a pension of 40s. per annum or less as a result of the dissolution of the monasteries, hospitals, colleges, chantries, fraternities, guilds or other incorporations was, however, liable to pay the subsidy on the income of his/her pension.  Anyone else liable to pay the subsidy who was also charged with paying pensions to the ex-religious were to be allowed to retain the 2s. in the pound in each of the four years, to his own relief.  Lay farmers or other lessees of forms of spiritual income were likewise liable to pay the subsidy on behalf of their landlords, unless they could produce any writings, covenants or bonds that showed otherwise.  Spiritual possessions were not subject to payment of fifteenths or other taxes granted by the laity, however.  Graduated rates were to be paid by stipendiary clergy.  Unbeneficed clergy in receipt of an annual stipend of £8 or less were to pay a flat rate of 6s.8d. per annum in each of the three years, those receiving an annual stipend of more than £8 up to £10 were to pay 10s. each year, those receiving an annual stipend of more than £10 up to 20 marks were to pay 13s. 4d. each year, and those receiving an annual stipend of more than 20 marks were to pay 2s. in the pound each year, just as beneficed clergy.  The subsidy was to be collected by the bishops and their appointees in every diocese, or by the dean and chapter in the case of a vacant see.  The subsidy was to be collected in one annual payment on 25 March each year, and paid into the Exchequer by the following 10 June.  Collectors were empowered to compel payment of the subsidy from any defaulters by sequestration of the fruits and profits of their benefices or offices, after lawful warning given to them, and to release them from any ecclesiastical censures under which they had been placed, once their payment had been received, and revoke all process made against them.  After a first refusal to pay, the defaulter was liable for the collector\'s costs in coming, going and demanding the tax, and after a second refusal, he was bound to pay the fourth part of the subsidy in addition to the amount that he had been assessed to pay.  In the event of obstinate and persistent refusal to pay, the defaulter would be deprived of his benefice or office 30 days after due warning.

These \'arrears\' were to be collected in the following year, on the same dates and under the same terms as the four payments of the subsidy (i.e., collected on 25 March 1562 and paid into the Exchequer by 10 June 1562).For a notarial copy of the grant made by the northern province, see E 179/64/335.(Wilkins, |Concilia|, IV, p 156; PRO, E 179/64/355, fol 2v; |Stat Realm|, IV, pp 332-335 (4 &amp; 5 Philip &amp; Mary, c. 10); P.R.N.

31,1193 April 20 or later ,aid to ransom the king ,Richard I ,"On his return journey from the Third Crusade Richard I fell into the hands of  Leopold duke of Austria at the end of 1192, and was handed over to the Emperor Henry VI, an enemy, in March 1193.  He offered a ransom of 100,000 marks and agreed to pay in addition a tribute of £5,000, from which he was eventually released on Henry&#8217;s death in 1197.  The king wrote to his mother, Queen Eleanor, and his justices (in effect, his council) in England from Hagenau on 19 April 1193, asking them to raise 70,000 marks, which the emperor required before he would release him.  According to Roger of Howden, on the basis of the letter they ordained that all men, lay or clerical, should give a quarter of their rents for that year for the king&#8217;s ransom, plus the same proportion of  their moveable goods, so that the king would be grateful to them.  William of Newburgh more vaguely says that &#8216;according to the amount of their revenues [all] were forced to pay a fair amount of money for the ransom&#8217;, while Ralph of Diss, Gervase of Canterbury and Ralph of Coggeshall state that the fourth consisted of rents only.  Howden continued that knights&#8217; fees were to be charged at 8s. each, and the Cistercian and Gilbertine orders were to contribute all their wool clip for the year.  The king had specified in his letter that all the gold and silver of the churches was to be included, with a promise to repay.  Guardians of the ransom were appointed, the archbishop-elect of Canterbury, the bishop of London, the earls of Arundel and Warenne, and the mayor of London.  It seems from the pipe roll that it was laid up in St Paul&#8217;s cathedral.  William of Newburgh states that the king&#8217;s council were disappointed at the results of the first levy and had to ask for a second and a third, then being forced to ask for the gold and silver plate of the churches.  The ransom was thus to be raised from a combination of kinds of levy, of which that of the quarter of rents and moveables, if Howden&#8217;s account was the most accurate, was the most demanding; the Saladin tithe of 1188, set at only a tenth, had caused a storm of protest.  The contents of the pipe roll begun at Michaelmas 1193 shows that payments were collected very rapidly; it seems that the fourth and the second levy, perhaps on those who had chattels to the value of more than 10s, were collected before the pipe roll of Michaelmas 1193 was made up.  The king of Scotland contributed 2,000 marks.In the meantime, the emperor had raised his terms.  On 29 June 1193 a formal treaty was made between king and empereror revising the terms to a payment of 100,000 silver  marks for the king&#8217;s release, and another 50,000 marks, 20,000 of them for the duke of Austria, for which hostages were to be provided.  Terms were also agreed for the delivery of the money, which was to remain Richard&#8217;s responsibility until it reached the limits of the empire.  The greater part of the ransom was collected and handed over to the imperial representative in London.  Richard was released in February 1194 and returned to England in March.  The portion to Duke Leopold was never paid, because he forgave it in December 1194 when at the point of death.There is no enrolled account for the ransom, which is known from many references in the pipe rolls to have been paid in to a special &#8216;exchequer of the ransom&#8217;.  It is therefore difficult to clearly identify the different elements of it from the other sources which are available.  Many further references in the pipe rolls call the levy on knights&#8217; fees the &#8216;scutage of knights for the ransom of the lord king&#8217;; this element of the ransom is therefore easy to identify.  A surviving receipt roll fragment for Easter term 1195 (E 401/2, m 3) records in a damaged heading what it calls some receipts from the first and second tallages of the ransom, the second being a levy on  &#8216;10s and upwards&#8217;, others for what are called a hidage, a clerical aid of a twentieth, and the fourth, one Somerset entry seeming to equate the latter with the first tallage, while another apparently identifies it with the &#8216;aid of the free men&#8217; of Geoffrey fitz Peter.  References to &#8216;chalices&#8217; clearly relate to the clerical gold and silver mentioned by Howden, while there are mentions of the redemption of chalices in a few ecclesiastical sources.  The other supplementary source is a summary of the returns to an inquest into the levy,  recorded in the roll of the Wiltshire eyre which was held in the autumn of 1194 (KB 26/3).   The eyre justices were asked in one of their articles to enquire \'concerning the aids given for the king&#8217;s ransom, how much every man has promised, how much he has paid, and how much is in arrear\'.  Some of the references in roll that refer to fines levied to compound for payment of the fourth, while others seem, according to Maitland, to equate with the fourth (called the first levy), the aid on 10s and upwards (the second levy) and the hideage (the third levy, authorised in April 1194 on Richard&#8217;s return and recorded separately in this list).  The pipe roll for Michaelmas 1193 has references to the first and second &#8216;tallages&#8217; of the ransom, while the Wiltshire returns describe them indifferently as &#8216;aids&#8217; or &#8216;tallages&#8217;.

32,1194 April 1 ,hidage or carucage of 2s. ,Richard I ,"This tax, of 2s. on the carucate, was imposed by the king on 1 April 1194, the third day of a council held at Nottingham after the fall of Count John&#8217;s castle there; Howden said that it had been called &#8216;Temantale&#8217; from ancient times, so evidently equating it with the old geld, which was usually levied at a rate of 2s.  On the same day, the king demanded that those who owed military service should cross to Normandy with him with a third of the service they owed.  He also exacted from the Cistercians their whole wool clip for the year, then remitted it in return for a money fine.F W Maitland showed that this tax was levied on the old Danegeld assessment of 1084, and it was a further stage in the taxation for payment of the king&#8217;s ransom, a point clearly made by the way to which it is referred in pipe rolls.  The men of Kesteven and Holland in Lincolnshire fined 100 marks to be held to such service of carucates and hides as in the time of the king&#8217;s ancestors, that is to maintain the ancient assessment, which was very different from that which applied to Lindsey.  The sheriff of Cumberland  paid a  fine to the justices for the hideage of his county.

37,c. 1198 March 29 ,carucage of 5s. ,Richard I ,"About Easter 1198, when the king was at Le Mans, a carucage of 5s. per carucate or hide was imposed throughout England.  Information about the machinery of its collection is given in great detail in Roger of Howden&#8217;s chronicle.  A clerk and a knight were sent to each county to assess and collect it.  They, the sheriff and legal knights chosen for the purpose, were to take an oath that they would faithfully execute the king&#8217;s business, causing to come before them the stewards of the barons of that county, the lord or bailiff of each vill, and the reeve and four legal men of the vill, free or unfree, and two legal knights of the hundred.  They  were to swear that they would say, faithfully and without fraud, how many  cultivated carucates there were in each vill; how many of them were in demesne; how many in villeinage; how many in alms to religious men, which the donors or their heirs should hold to warrant or acquit, or for which religious men owe service.  On each cultivated carucate they were to impose at the king&#8217;s order two shillings, and afterwards three shillings.  The free fees of the parish churches were to be exempt, but baronial escheats in the king&#8217;s hands were to contribute.  Serjeanties not held by knight service were to be exempt, but the number of carucates, the value of the lands and the names of the serjeants were to be written down; all the serjeants were summoned to London on 31 May to hear and perform the king&#8217;s command.  Those appointed to do the king&#8217;s business were to allocate 100 acres of land to each hide, by the estimate of legal men.  They were thus seeking to establish a uniform fiscal carucate of 100 acres.  The reference to the imposition of 2s. per carucate and later 3s. suggests a staged collection in two unequal instalments, but the date or dates for collection are not recorded, only the date for the serjeants to appear in London. All these things were to be written down in rolls, the clerk to have one roll, the knight another, the sheriff a third, and the baron&#8217;s steward a fourth concerning the lands of his lord.  The money was to be received by the hands of two legal knights of each hundred and the hands of the bailiffs of the hundred.  They were to answer for it to the sheriff, and through the rolls the sheriff was to answer at the Exchequer before the bishops, abbots and barons assigned for the purpose.  Punishments were also prescribed for attempts to evade the tax.  It was ordained that any unfree man convicted of perjury should give to the king his best beast of the plough, and also answer to him for the amount concealed by the perjury.  If a free man were convicted, he would be in mercy, and also liable to refund from his own goods the amount that he had concealed.  It was provided that a baron should, with the sheriff, make distraints on his men; if by his default distraints were not made, they were to be made on the demesne of the baron.No detailed accounts of the carucage can be certainly identified, but many of the assessments on serjeants with valuations were recorded in the Book of Fees, a fact that went unnoticed until 1888.  According to Howden, clerical refusal to pay the carucage resulted in a royal edict that denied legal satisfaction to any cleric who had been wronged by another, while he himself remained obliged to make satisfaction to any he had wronged. Despite these detailed plans, the government seem to have doubted that the assessment had been adequate or that the amount of tax corresponded with the amount of taxable land, since it inserted two questions concerning it into the articles of enquiry given to the justices in eyre who were sent on circuit in the autumn of 1198.  Article 11 instructed the justices to report the names of those holding serjeanties, how much they were worth, who had and who had not made fines for the royal aid, and to take fines.  Part of article 20 ordered them to enquire concerning hides and carucates in each county, and whether the commissioners who had served had conducted themselves well, collected from everyone who ought to have paid, and if they had concealed anything.  As a result of these eyres there were many fines &#8216;for the carucage&#8217; or &#8216;for quittance&#8217; of the carucage, or &#8216;that there shall be no inquisition concerning the carucage&#8217;, to prevent the holding of inquests into the accuracy of the assessments, in the first pipe roll of John&#8217;s reign.  Because of these proceedings, Mitchell concluded that the attempt made in this tax to revive the Danegeld on the basis of a new assessment of carucates of uniform size was a failure.

There was much opposition to the levy, particularly from the bishops of Lincoln and Salisbury, who refused outright to contribute on the grounds that their lands only owed military service in England. The strength of the opposition led to the resignation of Hubert Walter, who was replaced by Richard I on 11 July 1198.  This date provides a terminus post quem.Whether this scutage was ever put in charge is unclear: it seems unlikely, since peace with France was concluded in December 1198.

404,1377 Oct 22 x Nov 14 ,two fifteenths and tenths ,Richard II ,"Richard II\'s first parliament convened on 13 October 1377.  In view of Richard\'s age, and since no formal regency had been agreed with Edward III, a council of nine was appointed, of which no member could sit for more than a year or be re-elected within two years.  The king\'s uncles were not to be members of this council but were to ensure that the council was free from corruption. Much had to be dealt with before taxation could be discussed, and internal evidence of the parliamentary records suggests that it was unlikely that the grant of two fifteenths and tenths was made before 22 October.  A condition of the grant was that two London members of parliament be made treasurers for the tax, the receipts of which were to be spent only on the foreign campaign to be led by the king\'s uncle, John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster.  William Walworth and John Philpot were accordingly appointed to receive the tax; their receipts are recorded on the Exchequer receipt rolls (E 403/466, 468).Both fifteenths and tenths were to be collected in one payment, by 2 February 1378, and commissions for collection of the tax were issued on 14 November 1377.The military campaign proved a miserable failure, and the duke of Lancaster was still in England when a new parliament was summoned in April 1378.(|Rot.

405,1379 May 27 ,poll tax and graduated income tax ,Richard II ,"In the parliament which convened on 20 October 1378 at Gloucester a grant of taxation had been demanded, but this demand was refused on the grounds that a large grant had been made to the king in the previous year, to be levied in an unprecedentedly short time, and that no significant war expenses had since been incurred.  The commons rejected claims that the cost of Richard II\'s coronation justified the grant of another tax.  On being shown the accounts of the previous tax, they protested that that tax had been granted for defence of the realm only, and its proceeds should not have been used for war expenditure abroad.  Compounding their grievances was the disastrous outcome of the planned expedition to France in the previous year, and the fact that a great council in February had authorised the raising of loans, anticipating a parliamentary grant, to finance a further naval expedition, which the commons viewed as an infringement of their liberties.  The royal finances were, however, in a lamentable state.Against this background, the third parliament of Richard II\'s reign assembled on 25 April 1379, but it did not make a grant of taxation until 27 May, the last day of the session, when a combined poll tax and graduated income tax on the laity was voted.  At the same time, the commons appointed a committee to investigate the king\'s finances.  Lay persons of substantial means were to pay according to a scale of charges based on rank or occupation, although there was some flexibility within these gradations to take account of varying levels of wealth and income.  Everyone over the age of 16, who did not fall into one of these categories, was to be charged a poll tax of 4d. per head.Commissions for assessment of the tax in each county and city were issued on 27 May, the same day of the grant.  Their instructions were to \'go in person from place to place...and summon before them two men and the constable of every town, and the mayor, bailiffs and two men of every city and borough...in order to inform themselves by their oath touching the number, names, estates and rank of the persons there\'.  The assessment was to be made \'by such oath and information, and by such other ways and means as they shall think best\'.  The assessors were then to inform the collectors, who were appointed by separate commissions on the same day, of the numbers and names of persons assessed, and of their \'ranks and estates\'.  This information was to be conveyed to the collectors by indentures, which were to be used to \'control\' the assessments and were to be submitted to the Exchequer with the accounts of the collectors.  The commissions issued to the collectors instructed them to collect the tax in two payments - on 24 June 1379 and 1 August 1379.The graduated scale of rates was as follows:Dukes of Lancaster and Brittany - 10 marksearls - £4barons, bannerets and wealthy knights - 40s.bachelor knights and esquires of knightly estate - 20s.esquires of lesser estate - 6s.8d.esquires without property who are in service - 3s.4d.justices - 100s.serjeants and great apprentices at law - 40s.other apprentices at law - 20s.apprentices of lesser estates and attorneys - 6s.8d.mayor of London - £4London aldermen - 40s.mayors of large cities - 40s.mayors of small cities - 20s., 10s. or 1/2 mark (according to estate)great merchants - 20s.sufficient merchants - 13s.4d.lesser merchants and artisans - 6s.8d., 3s.4d., 2s., 12d. or 6d. (according to estate)serjeants and franklins - 6s.8d. or 40d.farmers of manors, parsonages or grangesand merchants of animals - 1/2 mark, 40d., 2s. or 12d.married advocates, notaries and procurators - 40s., 20s. or 1/2 markmarried pardoners and summoners - 3s.4d., 2s. or 12d.all hostellers not of merchant estate - 40d., 2s. or 12d.Widows were to pay the same rates as their husbands would have paid.  Married men not falling into any of the above categories had to pay 4d. for themselves and their wives, and unmarried individuals paid 4d. for themselves alone. However it seems local taxers were liable to adapt the scale of charges, so that for example a labourer or indeed a freeman might be charged 6d. (e.g. in E 179/369/19). Foreign merchants were charged the same rates as English merchants of the same status, and no one was to be charged anywhere other than in their place of residence.  The men of Chester were historically exempt from taxes granted in parliament, since they sent no representatives; however, on 4 August they were instructed to assemble and decide how much they were prepared to contribute towards the levy.By midsummer it was clear that there had been widespread under-assessment and evasion.   On 8 August 1379 new commissions were issued for assessments, after reports that assessors had \'either wilfully or by negligence omitted some persons from the assessment and assessed others too favourably\'.  Assessors were to make enquiries and re-assess the inhabitants of their area, and new collectors were also appointed on the same day to collect the re-assessed tax. (|Rot.

406,1380 Jan 17 x March 3 ,one and a half fifteenths and tenths ,Richard II ,"Parliament convened on 16 January 1380 and business began the next day.  Faced with another demand for money, the commons disputed the need for the levy of a further tax.  They insisted that the council of nine be abolished, since Richard was now the same age that Edward III had been at his coronation and therefore capable of ruling alone, and expressed their belief that the council had been incompetent in managing war expenditure, arguing that the normal five officers of state (chancellor, treasurer, keeper of the privy seal, chamberlain and steward) should be elected instead, and that the commons be informed of their names. They also wanted the king\'s household expenses to be scrutinised by a commission of enquiry.Parliament did, however, grant one and a half fifteenths and tenths, before adjourning on 3 March.  The first whole fifteenth and tenth was considered a \'pure and free gift\' to the king, while the additional half was only an \'advance or loan\' until the next parliament.  The commons grudgingly referred to the tax as another \'grevouse charge pur eux endurer ou porter\' and the grant carried several conditions.  The entire sum, together with the clerical taxes, the last poll tax, and the customs revenues, had to be applied solely to an expedition to Brittany to be led by the earl of Buckingham, and was to be kept separate from the king\'s other revenue and administered by a royal commission.The prevailing mood of resentment, attested by the chancellor\'s reference in his opening speech to recent riots, is no cause for surprise.  As Dr. Saul points out, \'since 1377 over £250,000 had been spent on the war. Yet there were no victories at sea or in the field, and no territorial gains to show for it.\'  On the contrary, the earl of Arundel\'s entire fleet had been lost at sea.Two towns were exempt from the levy; both Newport (Isle of Wight) and Seaford (Sussex) had suffered damage from French raids and were excused payment. Both the whole and half fifteenth and tenth were to be collected by 23 April 1380, and commissions for collection were issued on 4 March 1380. (|Rot.

407,1380 Dec 6 ,poll tax ,Richard II ,"Parliament assembled on 5 November 1380 at Northampton.  Many of the magnates were absent, mustering for the Scottish campaign or abroad in France, although the king\'s uncle, John of Gaunt, was present.  The government was still in severe financial difficulties, caused, according to the chancellor, by the disruption of the wool and cloth trade due to unrest in Flanders.  The army had not been paid for months and the desertion of important fortresses was imminent; the king was in debt and his jewels in hock.  Yet the commons were unwilling to accede to the chancellor\'s demand for a grant of taxation, and he postponed the session until 9 November, making it clear that all members of parliament would be detained in Northampton until the king obtained satisfaction.When the session resumed, the commons asked to be informed what sum was required, and were presented with an itemised account of projected expenditure totalling £160,000 - a sum which they rejected as outrageous.  They asked the lords to consider ways in which a more moderate amount could be raised, and were offered three alternatives: a poll tax of four to five groats (16d or 20d) per person; a tax on all sales and purchases within the realm; or multiple fifteenths and tenths.  Of these three scenarios, the commons chose the first and only viable option, and the one also favoured by the lords.  Accordingly, a subsidy was granted which took the form of a poll tax on all persons of both sexes over 15 years of age, except for beggars, though at a lower rate than that suggested by the lords.  The level of taxation was still unprecedently high, however, and may reflect a growing belief among the ruling classes that the peasantry had become disproportionately affluent by evading the wage legislation of the 1350s.All individuals were to pay 12d (or 3 groats), but the more affluent of each vill were to assist the less well-off, provided that no one had to pay more than 60 groats for himself and his wife, nor was allowed to pay less than 1 groat (4d) for himself and his wife.  A tax of 12d was an average, therefore, rather than a fixed amount.  Artificers, labourers, servants (including those who served members of the clergy), and other lay persons were each to be taxed according to their estate, but the rates to be charged were not laid down in the statute.  The commons estimated that this tax would raise 100,000 marks for the king, but made its grant conditional upon the contribution from the clergy of an additional 50,000 marks.  They also insisted that the money be used for the maintenance of the Duke of Buckingham\'s army, and that the tax not be considered a precedent.  The parliamentary record makes it clear that all stages of the negotiations and deliberations over this matter were lengthy and difficult, and states that final agreement to the levy was not reached until 6 December.  The commons were apprehensive about popular reaction to the tax, and as in 1373, one of the conditions of the grant was that no one who had sat in the parliament in which it was granted was to be involved in its levy.On the next day, 7 December, two sets of commissions were issued in each county and city.  One commission was to the assessors, and the other to the collectors, and the same procedure was to be followed as for the levy of the poll tax of 1379.  Separate commissions to the sheriffs to assist in collection, a feature of previous poll taxes, were issued on 12 December.  The first two-thirds of the tax was due to be paid by 27 January 1381, and the remaining third was payable by 2 June 1381.The vagueness of the instructions on how to implement the graduation according to income may have been due to pressure of time: parliament had already been sitting for over a month, and the government was anxious to set the collection machinery in motion as soon as possible.  Soon after the initial commissions were issued, however, the government was forced to make substantial changes to them.  Additional members were appointed to them, and \'insufficient\' and \'infirm\' collectors were replaced.  In all, 83 changes to the personnel of the commissions issued in December were made.  Despite these alterations, widespread evasion occurred.  As McKisack noted, the returns absurdly suggest a fall of one third in the adult population between 1377 and 1381: Dr. Saul\'s figure for those who had \'disappeared from the rolls\' since 1377 is 450,000.On 2 January 1381, the sheriffs and escheators were ordered to enquire into the number, abode and wealth of the laity in each county and certify their findings to the Exchequer, bypassing the commissioners appointed earlier to assess the tax.  On 20 February, suspecting that many collectors had in fact already received all the proceeds of the tax, the king ordered the entire grant to be paid by 22 April.  It was clear, however, that in some counties the process of assessment and collection had broken down completely.  Fresh commissions were therefore issued in certain counties on 16 March 1381, which instructed the collectors to levy the whole by 21 April, and conferred powers of indefinite imprisonment of \'contrariant or rebellious\' persons refusing to pay.  Nevertheless, the extent of evasion and resistance to the tax must not be exaggerated.  For example, the writs issued to the sheriffs on 8 April instructing them to hasten the collectors\' payment of the tax into the Exchequer were part of the normal process of lay taxation.The second attempt to levy the tax led to enormous resentment in some counties.  The abandonment of the duke of Buckingham\'s planned invasion, after the defection to the French of his ally, the duke of Brittany, in mid-January 1381, meant that the |raison d\'etre| for the grant of the tax and the continuation of its levy were eliminated.  Moreover, there may have been a popular misconception that the collection of both payments of the tax at one time in fact represented an entirely new tax, which had not been authorised by parliament.  It was this collection, in the early summer of 1381, which sparked the Peasants\' Revolt.As well as the numerous documents for this tax in the E 179 series, an assessment for Williton hundred in Somerset is now at LR 11/30/428.(|Rot.

408,1382 Oct 9 x 18 ,fifteenth and tenth ,Richard II ,"Parliament opened on 6 October 1382, and because many members had not yet arrived, was adjourned until 8 October.  On 9 October, the assembly heard of the continued need to enforce law and order on the king\'s enemies both within the realm, making reference to \'riotours et aultres malfaisours\', and without, and of the Duke of Lancaster\'s desire to mount an expedition to Spain.  After receiving the advice of a panel of peers, a tax of a fifteenth and tenth was granted to the king by 18 October.In exchange for this grant, the commons received \'an extraordinary concession\' from the king.  The parliament roll specified that the tax was to be levied on \'tout la communaltee\', which was expressly to include the aristocracy and gentry, even if they had hitherto been exempt.  These taxpayers were to be assessed on all their \'bledz et bestaill\', and on the profits of their demesne lands, and lands appropriated in mortmain since 20 Edward I, expressly to relieve the poverty of the peasantry, who appeared to the assembly to be greatly impoverished.  It was made clear, however, that the imposition of this condition was not to set a precedent for future grants.  The commons also deemed that the total sum that was collected could not be either greater or lesser than that received for the previous fifteenth and tenth.Commissions to the collectors were issued on 2 November 1382, and payment of the whole was to be made by 2 February 1383.  However, on 6 December 1382 further commissions were issued ordering the collectors to proceed with the levy in advance of the due date.  Haste was required because Richard II was planning an expedition to Calais, which was then under threat of siege by the king of France. (|Rot. Parl|., III, pp 132-137; R.

Parliament assembled again on 26 October 1383, and on the following day, the chancellor declared that a foreign war was imminent and asked for an immediate tax grant, warning that no member of parliament would be allowed to leave before this had been achieved, without obtaining the king\'s express permission.Before adjourning on 26 November, parliament did grant a half fifteenth and tenth, but certain conditions were attached.  All members of the laity, however exalted their rank, had to contribute to the tax, and the clergy had to make an identical grant.  The tax was to be paid by 20 January 1384.  If no peace with France was subsequently concluded, then another half fifteenth and tenth was to be paid by 29 May 1384.  The same proviso was in effect as at the last grant of a fifteenth and tenth - that the sum collected was not to exceed that previously collected for this tax. Commissions for collection were issued for the first half fifteenth and tenth on 28 November 1383.  The second half fifteenth and tenth was not levied; another parliament convened and granted a half fifteenth and tenth before it was to have been paid.(|Rot.

When it resumed, the chancellor made it clear that the king expected a speedy grant of taxation from the assembly and, as in the previous session, members were told that no one could leave before a satisfactory conclusion had been reached, unless the king\'s express permission had been obtained. On 14 May the commons asked to be allowed to consult with a delegation of named individuals from the lords.  After much debate, as the parliament roll states, a half fifteenth and tenth was granted before dissolution of the assembly on 27 May, on condition that the clergy agreed to make an identical grant.  The tax was to be paid on 29 September 1384.  If a peace with France was not subsequently concluded, another half fifteenth and tenth was payable on 25 March 1385.  This conditional second half fifteenth and tenth was cancelled, however, in the parliament which met in November-December 1384.Commissions to the collectors were issued on 27 May 1384.  On 7 August 1384, some of the collectors in Kent, Surrey, Middlesex, Essex and London were ordered to pay their receipts to Gauterns de Bardes, from whom the king had borrowed 4,000 marks.(|Rot Parl|, III, pp 166-168; |CFR 1383-1391|, pp. 45-50; |CCR 1381-1385|, p 467)enrolled account: E 359/16, rots 8-9 ",Origin  Granted,"1st: 1384 Sept 29, 2nd: 1385 March 25"
411,1384 Nov 15 x Dec 14 ,fifteenth and tenth ,Richard II ,"Parliament formally assembled on 12 November 1384, but the chancellor did not address the commons until 15 November, when he stressed the need for a hasty debate and grant of taxation to the king, and warned them against dilatory tactics.  Before its adjournment on 14 December, parliament complied with the request for taxation.  The commons had been swayed, at least in part, by the king\'s intention to lead an expedition abroad in person.The conditional second half fifteenth and tenth granted in the previous parliament had been cancelled, presumably because the conditions imposed for the levy had not been met.  In its place a grant was made of two whole fifteenths and tenths, although the second fifteenth and tenth was conditional, and would take effect only if a peace treaty or truce were not concluded, and if the king himself personally went to war.  Parliament\'s concern that the money should be spent for the purpose of war was manifest in the commissions for collection, issued on 16 December 1384, which made specific mention of the fact that the tax money was to be \'expended upon the defence of the realm and the marches of Scotland\'.The first fifteenth and tenth was to be paid by 25 March 1385, and the second by 24 June 1385.  No commissions, however, were issued to collect the latter fifteenth and tenth, the grant of which was evidently cancelled.  On 5 June 1385, the collectors of the first fifteenth and tenth in Northumberland and Cumberland were granted a delay, and payment from those counties was deferred until 1 August. (|Rot.

Despite the failure of the king\'s recent Scottish campaign, parliament eventually granted him one and a half fifteenths and tenths, before adjourning on 6 December, but with several conditions attached.It was demanded, firstly, that no further taxes were to be collected while this tax was being levied.  The one and a half fifteenths and tenths were not to be paid to the Exchequer, but to two London citizens, John Hadley and Nicholas Exton, who were to act as war treasurers.  Their expenditure of the tax revenue was to be supervised by John Lord Cobham and the bishop of Exeter.  The two treasurers were to certify their receipts to the Exchequer, and to submit weekly details of disbursements in the same way; they were each to receive £20 for their time and trouble.  Thirdly, the money collected was to be expended only for military purposes - for the duke of Lancaster\'s expedition to Spain, the protection of the sea and Scottish marches, and in relief of the city of Ghent.It was originally proposed that the cost of the king\'s Scottish expedition should be met by levying a scutage, but this plan \'was abandoned in the face of strong opposition, mainly from the knights in parliament\'.The whole fifteenth and tenth was payable by 2 February 1386 and the half was to be paid by 24 June 1386.

They brought such pressure to bear upon the king that he was forced to remove his erstwhile favourites.On 10 March 1388, registering their satisfaction with this turn of events, parliament granted the king a half fifteenth and tenth.  The commons made it clear, however, that no precedent was set by their agreement to taxation before the parliament had ended and the king had offered redress of their grievances.  Once again, it was expressly stated that the money raised was to be used only to finance a military expedition abroad, led by the earl of Arundel. The tax was payable on 12 April 1388, and commissions for collection were issued on 10 March 1388. (|Rot.

414,1386 Oct 23 x Nov 28 ,half a fifteenth and tenth ,Richard II ,"During the spring and summer of 1386, there had been a general fear of invasion in the south of England.  To procure the funds needed for the country\'s defence, the government borrowed money in anticipation of a grant of taxation from parliament.  On 8 August 1386, writs of summons to a parliament were issued, and on 1 October 1386 the \'Wonderful Parliament\' was convened.  The chancellor, Michael de la Pole, demanded a grant of taxation, claiming once again that the king himself was about to undertake a military expedition abroad to defend the realm.  According to the chronicler Henry Knighton, the original amount requested was four fifteenths and tenths, payable within a year.To this demand, the commons responded with a list of grievances against the chancellor, one of which was that he had not spent the revenue from the previous levy of fifteenths and tenths on defence, as they had directed, but had diverted it elsewhere.  On 23 October Chancellor de la Pole was dismissed, to which, Knighton reported, the king had agreed only when threatened with deposition; he was replaced by Thomas Arundel, bishop of Ely.  Pole was later subject to impeachment proceedings, while a council composed of bishops and the king\'s uncles was established to investigate and manage Richard II\'s finances. Only after Pole\'s dismissal was parliament prepared to make a grant of taxation, which was agreed before the assembly dissolved on 28 November at half a fifteenth and tenth, payable by 2 February 1387.  Once again, a conditional second half fifteenth and tenth was granted, to be collected by 13 October 1387, but this grant would take effect only if the first half proved insufficient for the costs of defence.  A condition imposed on the grant was that if the king interfered with the supervisory council in any way, then the collection of the tax money would cease.Commissions for the collection of the first half were issued on 28 November 1386.  No commissions were issued for the collection of the second half, which was not levied. (|Rot.

By this time the political climate had changed, and the Lords Appellant were no longer a coherent group.  Despite its disappointment that the Appellants had failed to finance the war solely with the ordinary revenue of the crown, parliament granted a fifteenth and tenth before dissolution on 17 October.  The tax was payable in two equal instalments, on 25 March and 24 June 1389. Commissions to the collectors for both payments were issued on 16 November 1388.  On 16 May 1389, however, the king \'of his own mere motion, without advice from anyone else\' remitted the second instalment, which has been variously interpreted as a gesture of goodwill and reconciliation on his formal assumption of personal power, and a cynical manoeuvre to gain sympathy and undermine the solidarity of the opposition.  The order to the collectors instructs them not merely to suspend the collection, but to repay any money already collected, and although it is clear from its wording that the king left himself the option to reinstate the collection, he in fact never did.

In order to finance a peace conference between Richard II and the king of France, a grant of a half fifteenth and tenth was made before parliament was dissolved on 2 December.  The collection of the tax was to commence on 25 March 1392 and was to be completed by 21 April.  A further whole fifteenth and tenth was conditionally granted, if the king went to war and no peace or truce was forthcoming.  This tax would be collected by 24 June 1392.  In the event, the treaty was renewed annually from 1392 onwards, and the whole fifteenth and tenth was accordingly never levied.Commissions for the collection of the half fifteenth and tenth were issued on 19 January 1392.

The receipts from the first payment were to be used to finance an expedition by the king either to Scotland or to Ireland.  If the king did not personally lead such an expedition, the money collected was to be kept safely by the treasurer.  The proceeds from the second payment were also to be set aside by the treasurer, to be used in case there was a renewal of the war with France.  A further conditional half fifteenth and tenth was also granted, which was to be levied only if the king mounted a campaign to France; this tax would be payable by 2 February 1394.

He asked for a grant of taxation to help finance the king\'s Irish expedition.Before dissolving on 15 February, parliament granted a fifteenth and tenth, to be levied in two equal payments, on 30 May and 11 November 1395.Collectors were appointed for both instalments on 12 March 1395.

The main business of the parliament was to exact vengeance on the Lords Appellant and their supporters, who had risen against the king in 1387-8.On 31 January 1398, however, the commons granted one and a half fifteenths and tenths to the king, to be paid in three equal instalments, on 27 October 1398, and 13 April and 13 October 1399.  Commissions for collection of all three payments were issued on 28 May 1398.On 30 September 1399, before the levy of the last payment, Henry Bolingbroke, duke of Lancaster, overthrew Richard II.  In the first parliament of Henry IV, which began on 6 October, the new king was granted that part of the tax which remained outstanding, but he remitted payment. (|Rot.

In the interim, as part of a general campaign to extort money from persons who had risen with the Lords Appellant in 1387-8, a commission was appointed on 20 December 1397 to assemble the men of Essex and Hertfordshire in their county courts in order that they might \'offer\' the sum of £2,000 to Richard II in return for a pardon of all their treasonable activities before 1 October 1397 and the discharge of their sheriff for all bad debts in the counties.The two knights of the shire for these counties were instructed to appear at the new session of parliament with the consent of the king\'s lieges in Essex and Hertfordshire to these exactions.  Essex was to pay two thirds of the sum (2,000 marks), and the remaining 1,000 marks would be paid by Hertfordshire.  This \'free gift\' was to be raised from the lieges of the counties and those having \'lands, possessions and rents\' there.  The first commission for assessment and collection was issued on 5 February, citing payment in equal thirds in the month of Easter (April), and on the quinzaine of midsummer and Michaelmas.  Authority was given to them to compel payment by imprisonment or otherwise, and the king was to be informed of the names of those who refused to contribute.  On 26 April a new commission was issued, this time requesting payment of the whole sum by 20 May.  In neither writ is the rate of assessment specified; it was to be decided by the wise men, knights, prelates and squires.  The commission issued on 26 April to the Essex collectors and enrolled on the fine roll can be found at E 179/242/83, attached to their account.More than 2,000 marks were paid by the inhabitants of Essex; the sum of £1,602 6s.8d (£269 in excess of the sum required from them) was received at the Exchequer in twelve payments over the period 13 May 1398 to 30 January 1399.  These were recorded on the receipt rolls, but the official enrolment on the \'foreign accounts\' gave them credit for only the agreed 2,000 marks (E 401/609, 611; E 364/34, rot. 13d).  Although the sheriff of the two counties was issued with letters patent in February 1398 exonerating him from collecting ancient farms or bad debts, there is no record that the men of these counties received the promised pardon of their activities in 1387-8.  No payment from Hertfordshire is recorded as having been received, however, which may have furnished Richard II with an excuse for not fulfilling this part of the bargain.(|Rot.

587,1397 Aug - Sept ,forced loan ,Richard II ,"In the late summer of 1397, the period of Richard II\'s tyranny over his subjects began, which was to end in his deposition in September 1399.  One feature of that tyranny was a forced loan imposed in August and early September 1397.  The chronicler Thomas Walsingham claimed that Richard\'s commissioners were sent around the country at that time with letters under the royal seal specifying the sums which were to be lent, but leaving the names of the lenders to be filled in by the commissioners after they had discovered who was in a position to lend the king money by making secret enquiries.Surviving indentures made between the commissioners and the lenders, as well as annotated lists of persons approached by the commissioners, survive in E 34/1B and E 101/512/9, and possibly also in E 101/512/7.  These reveal something of the procedure actually followed by the commissioners, which was not quite as nefarious as that described by Walsingham.  Letters under the privy seal, none of which survive, were apparently delivered by the king\'s serjeants-at-arms to substantial persons, religious houses (and secular clergy), and towns, asking them to lend \'notable\' sums.  Those agreeing to lend indented with the king\'s serjeants for a specific sum to be paid on a certain date.  Most, but not all of the indentures, also specify the date by which the loan was to be repaid.  The greater part were written in August or early September and promised payment of the loan by Michaelmas or Christmas of that year.  Occasionally, gifts, rather than loans, were promised.  Many persons on the commissioners\' lists, however, simply have \'nul\' written against their names.The lists drawn up by these commissioners of those persons they had approached reveal that, though there may have been an element of compulsion, it was possible to refuse to loan money, provided a good excuse was given.  On the basis of the lists, indentures and records of the receipts from these loans, Caroline Barron has estimated that the 220 lenders represents only about one in three of those asked to lend.  Nevertheless, those persons who would not lend could be asked to appear before the council with their excuses, and such a prospect was probably daunting enough to convince reluctant lenders to promise at least a small sum.The receipt rolls for 1397 record loans received in August and December amounting to just over £22,000 (E 401/606; E 401/608).  The king had some difficulty, however, in collecting the money promised in the indentures.  On 3 April 1398, and also in June 1398, he appointed commissioners in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, who were to cause the defaulters to come before them and pay all arrears due to the king from the promised loan, under threat of appearance before the king\'s council, arrest and imprisonment. Among the articles presented in the parliament of 1399 as grounds for Richard\'s deposition was his failure to repay these loans on the dates specified in the indentures.  The indentures drawn up with 194 individuals had promised repayment by Easter 1398, but in fact only eight out of the total 220 lenders are noted as having been repaid, and only two of these (Richard Whittington, mayor of London, and John Bernard, treasurer of Calais) were repaid by Easter 1398; two other lenders did not receive repayment until after the accession of Henry IV.Despite its contribution to Richard II\'s downfall, such \'forced\' loans were to become standard practice under his successors.(|Annales Ricardi Secundi|, in |J. de Trokelowe et H. de Blaneforde...chronica|, ed.

643,1392 Sept 19 - 1393 Feb 28 ,penal tax on the laity and clergy in London ,Richard II ,"In the summer of 1392, Richard II declared that he had found \'notable and evident defaults in the government and rule of the city of London\'.  Although minor infractions had undoubtedly occurred, there is nothing in either the records of the city or the crown, nor in the reports of chroniclers, which suggests that there was at the time anything but the usual level of strife and disorder in London; there was certainly considerably less than had existed in the previous decade.  Historians have been led to suspect, therefore, that the city\'s real crime was its refusal to lend money to the crown in its corporate capacity.  It had not provided the king with a loan since March 1388, and there had also been a marked decline in loans from individual Londoners.In May 1392 the king began his retaliation against the city by ordering the removal of the Court of Common Pleas from Westminster to York, which was followed by orders for the similar transferral of the Chancery, Exchequer and prisoners of the Fleet - a move designed to bring great inconvenience and loss of trade to the Londoners.  In the same month, the leading officials of the city were told to appear before the king at Nottingham on 25 June, \'under pain of forfeiture of life and limb\'.  On that day, the king had these elected officials removed from office and replaced with his own appointees.  A commission was also appointed to hold a major inquiry into the conduct of the city\'s affairs, and on 22 July the commission\'s verdict was announced.  The city\'s officials were found to have been guilty of negligence in their government.  Fines were to be levied against them and the city\'s liberties were to be forfeited to the king.  A corporate fine of £100,000 was also imposed on the city.A campaign to make peace with the king then began in earnest and the citizens managed to buy his pardon after a series of ceremonial gestures, symbolic gifts and the payment of large fines by the mayor, sheriffs and aldermen.  On 19 September, the fine of £100,000 on the city as a whole was remitted, in exchange for payment of a reduced fine of £10,000.  The restoration of the city\'s privileges ensued.To raise the fine of £10,000, payment of which was acknowledged by Richard II on 28 February 1393, a novel tax was imposed on both the laity and the clergy.  Although the rates levied on the laity are not known, one chronicler reported that the imposition of such a large sum caused many citizens to flee the city in order to avoid payment.  In the parliament sitting in January 1394, both the clergy and the widows of London presented petitions asking to be excused from contributing.  Both petitions protested against the novelty of the tax; the clergy were accustomed to paying only taxes granted by the clergy for the \'common profit of the realm\' (SC8/1052, 6036, 7343).  The new tax levied against them by the mayor and aldermen, however, charged a rate of 40d. in the pound on all tenements and rents belonging to benefices and churches in the city and suburbs.  The assessment made of clerical property for the levy of this tax survives among the city\'s records (Corporation of London Record Office, 239A) and has been printed in A.K. McHardy, |The Church in London 1375-1392| (London Record Society, XIII, 1977), pp 39-77.No records relating to the taxation of the laity are known to survive, but an ordinance recorded in the city\'s letter-book in May or June 1393 mandates that a further 5,000 marks be levied according to the rates assessed for the previous levy, presumably one which was collected in the latter part of 1392.  Some of the £10,000 fine is also known to have been raised by contributions from the London livery companies, by loans made to the chamberlain of the city and by payments made from the Bridge House estates.Such unpredictable levies were probably a source of worry to Londoners.  Perhaps remembering the hardship endured by his fellow citizens on this occasion, the prominent grocer and alderman of the city John Hadley, who was mayor in 1393, left money in his will of 1405 \'for the relief of poor freemen on the occasion of assessments for taxes and talliages\'.(C.M.

646,1391 Feb 9 or earlier ,"levy of 1,000 marks in North Wales ",Richard II ,"In 1390 or 1391, an attempt was made to levy a subsidy of 1,000 marks in North Wales.  The evidence for such a levy is a payment recorded on the issue roll.  On 9 February 1391, John Elyngeham was paid £6.13s.4d. for expenses incurred in travelling at Richard II\'s behest to North Wales, where he was to deliver a letter under the king\'s privy seal to John Massy, Richard Podyngton and other knights in those parts.  This letter ordered them to levy a tax of 1,000 marks there (E 403/532, 9 Feb. 1391).According to Dr. Saul, this \'subsidy\' was levied in the winter of 1389-1390, although it has not proved possible to discover exactly when Elyngeham\'s trip was made; neither his journey nor the date of the levy can be traced in any other source.  However, his account for several journeys in England and Wales, made between c.1382-1398 (E 101/319/9) shows that he originally claimed to have left London on 9 February, returning on 25 July, but these dates were later altered to 1 March and 22 May 1391, and the number of days of his stay reduced from 166 to 124 to a final total of 82.  It is at present impossible to determine how much money was raised by this means.  No returns to the Exchequer are recorded, and there is no reference to the tax in the records of parliament.As Ralph Griffiths has noted, there was a marked increase in the crown\'s financial demands upon its Welsh subjects in the later fourteenth century, in the form of judicial fines and extraordinary subsidies; these impositions were probably intended to compensate for declining revenue from customary rents.  Tuck also notes that a subsidy of 2000 marks was levied in Cheshire in the autumn of 1391, which may reflect the continued attempt to broaden the scope of revenue raising during this period, increasing the demand on areas not normally brought under the tax umbrella.(Saul, |Richard II|, p 258; R.A. Griffiths, \'Gentlemen and Rebels in Later Medieval Cardiganshire\', |Ceredigion|, V (1964-67), pp 154, 166n); A Tuck, |Richard II and the English Nobility| (London, 1973), p 144. ",Origin  Imposed,

723,1380 Feb 28 ,clerical tenth and poll tax from Canterbury province ,Richard II ,"On 2 December 1379 Richard II ordered the archbishops of Canterbury and York to summon the clergy of their provinces in convocation for the purpose of granting him a subsidy for the defence of the realm and the church.  The province of Canterbury assembled in convocation on 4 February 1380, but it was not until 28 February that the clergy could be persuaded to grant the king what might be deemed a hybrid tax, which combined the traditional clerical tenth with a flat rate poll tax on unbeneficed clergy.The tax was to be paid at the rate of 16d. in the mark (that is, a tenth) on all assessed benefices, according to the |Taxatio| of 1291, and 16d. in the mark on two-thirds of the values of benefices not assessed.  All beneficed clergy were to pay this tenth of their income, whether exempt or non-exempt, privileged or not privileged, including the clergy of royal and other free chapels, and of alien priories.

The province of York met in York on 4 April 1380 and granted, as in the southern province, what might be deemed a hybrid tax.  This tax combined the traditional clerical tenth with a flat rate poll tax on unbeneficed clergy.The tax was to be paid at the rate of 16d. in the mark (that is, a tenth) on all assessed benefices, and 16d. in the mark on two-thirds of the values of benefices not assessed.  All beneficed clergy were to pay this tenth of their income, whether exempt or non-exempt, privileged or not privileged, including the clergy of royal and other free chapels, and of alien priories.  Unbeneficed priests, advocates, registrars, proctors and notaries, who were not charged with the laity for the fifteenth, were to pay a poll tax of 2s. each.  An exception was to be made for \'such ecclesiastical persons and benefices as [were] unable to pay...owing to evident and notorious poverty,...and on this point the report of their diocesans [was to] be accepted without further proof\' (|CFR 1377-1383|, p 190).Commissions for collection were issued on 16 April 1380, and the names of the collectors were to be returned to the Exchequer by 12 May.

Parliament began sitting on 5 November and were still resisting the king\'s demands for a poll tax when the Canterbury convocation began its deliberations on the matter on 1 December.  On 5 December, the day before the laity gave in, they conceded a poll tax on the clergy.The tax was to be levied in two rates.  All clerks, both beneficed and unbeneficed, male and female, regular and secular, exempt and non-exempt, and all advocates, proctors, examiners, registrars and notaries public were to pay a tax of 20 groats (6s.8d.).  Clerks in minor orders (deacons, sub-deacons, acolytes and lower orders), aged 16 and older, \'provided they be not notoriously mendicants\', paid the lower rate of 3 groats (12d.).  The bishops of each diocese had some discretion as to which rate would be charged, and the unbeneficed and monastic clergy (below the rank of prior), at least in the dioceses of Lincoln and London, paid an intermediate rate of 3s.4d.  The vast majority of the clergy, however, were assessed to pay 6s.8d.Commissions for collection were issued on 20 December and the names of the collectors were to be certified to the Exchequer by 2 February 1381.  The tax was to be paid in two equal instalments, on 22 February and 24 June 1381, and the names of the taxpayers were to be returned to the Exchequer when the account was rendered.Surviving assessments for the diocese of Lincoln have been printed in McHardy, |Clerical Poll-Taxes of the Diocese of Lincoln 1377-1381|, pp 92-174.

Although the tax was collected in one of the two archdeaconries of the diocese of Durham (in Northumberland archdeaconry), there is no evidence that it was ever levied in the other archdeaconry (Durham).

Payment of the tax was to be made on 21 April.The conditions of the grant of the second moiety were that the temporal and spiritual lords who had been appointed to the king\'s council should stay in office as long as their appointment had specified, and that if they considered that the levy of the second moiety was necessary, then the tax was to be levied, but otherwise not.

The clergy of the diocese of York granted Richard II a subsidy of a tenth for the defence of the church, realm and English people against the incursions of hostile aliens, and so that the king may better support the clergy of the city and diocese of York.  The clergy of the dioceses of Durham and Carlisle, however, granted only a half of a tenth, and, like the second moiety of the tax granted by York diocese, this tax was to be levied only if certain conditions were met.  It was to be levied only if an enemy invasion of the province of York took place, and would not be collected if the clergy of the province were compelled to resist the invasion at their own cost and expense. It was to be levied according to the |Novo Taxatio| and there were certain exemptions from the tax.  No goods, benefices or temporalities in the counties of Northumberland and Cumberland, and within the bounds of Copeland (in Cumberland) were to be taxed, nor was the abbey of Egglestone in Yorkshire.  Also declared exempt were Cluniac and Benedictine nuns, and Augustinian canonesses, \'on account of their notorious poverty\'.The tax was to be collected on 1 November 1386, at the same time as the second moiety granted by the clergy of York diocese.

Firstly, it was stipulated that the royal writ for collection of the first moiety should not be issued before 30 May 1395, and that for the second not before 29 September 1395.  The second condition was that all nuns and religious women, of whatever order, were to be excused from payment of the tax.  They stipulated further that the bishops should make mention of the exemption of the nuns in their writs to their deputies for collection, and that this exemption was to be allowed by the Exchequer.

Meetings of the clergy in February 1397 did not produce a grant of taxation, however, and it was not until a new convocation met on 6 April that the clergy voted a subsidy of a moiety of a tenth to the king.There were conditions attached to the grant.  Although both exempt and non-exempt clergy had to pay the tax, only benefices valued at 6 marks and over, and accustomed to pay the tenth, were to be taxed, and the benefices of poor nuns (to be determined at the discretion of the bishop) were excused payment of the tax.  The tax was to be paid in two instalments, on 24 June and 1 November 1397.Initially, no commissions for collection were issued by the crown.  Instead, on 6 April, Thomas Arundel, archbishop of Canterbury (and chancellor of England) sent out instructions for the levy.  In a departure from the usual practice, the first payment of the tax was not to be paid into the Exchequer, but to be delivered to Richard Depedale, rector of the church of St. Mary Arches, London, and Master Denis Lopham, sub-collectors for the whole province, along with a list of all who refused to contribute.  The bishops were apparently told to certify the names of the collectors of the tax not to the Exchequer, but to the archbishop himself.  This, at least, was the course taken by the bishop of Lincoln.Whether or not the first instalment was collected in accordance with these instructions is a matter of some doubt.  The situation was complicated by the political crisis, which resulted in Archbishop Arundel being removed from the office of chancellor, deprived of his archiepiscopal see and declared a traitor on 25 September 1397.  A convocation was summoned for 8 October, but the meeting never took place.  No mandates for collection of the second instalment of the tax appear to have been issued before the tax was due to be collected on 1 November.It was not until 30 November that the king sent a mandate to the archbishop of Canterbury, or, in his absence, his vicar-general, directing him to command the bishops of his province to appoint collectors in their dioceses for the collection of both instalments.  They were to certify their names to the Exchequer by 13 January 1398 and apparently collect the tax as soon as possible.

The assembly was subsequently postponed, however, to 19 June.  Although he himself was unable to attend, Archbishop Waldby appointed a commission, headed by his vicar-general, to demand a subsidy of a tenth from the clergy on that occasion.

On 27 January 1399 he wrote to the archbishop of York ordering him to convoke the clergy of his province, \'as many times demanded\', in order \'to move them to grant [him] a subsidy\', on 3 March (|CCR 1396-1399|, p 440). The northern clergy began its deliberations at Beverley on 11 March, but it was not until 12 May, by which time they had adjourned to York, that the assembly granted the king a whole tenth and was then dismissed.Exempt from the levy were: (a) benefices in Cumberland, Copeland (in Cumberland), Westmorland and Northumberland which had been destroyed by the Scots; (b) all nuns in the province; (c) the abbeys of Egglestone (in Yorkshire), Calder (in Cumberland) and Rufford (in Nottinghamshire), because of their poverty; (d) the priories of Monk Bretton, Watton and Warter (all in Yorkshire), all overburdened with heavy charges and unable to support the payment; (e) all benefices, prebends, portions, pensions, hospitals and temporalities assessed according to the |Novo Taxatio| at £10 per annum or less; (f) the lands and possessions of the archbishop of York and the abbots of St. Mary\'s York and Selby in Marshland (Yorkshire) or elsewhere which have been destroyed by the floods of the Humber and other rivers; and (g) the £23 13s. 4d. for the tenth of £236 13s. 4d., which are the provents and farms of the lands, possessions and provents of churches which belonged of late to the abbot of Meaux and have been wholly destroyed by the inundation of the sea and the Humber River.  The tax was to be paid in two instalments: on May 1400 and May 1401.On 18 May 1399 the archbishop notified the king of the grant, but before any of the tax revenue could be collected Richard II had been deposed and the levy of the tax was suspended, but not totally forgotten.  In the summer of 1402, when Henry IV\'s councillors were trying to think of ways of raising revenue, it was remembered and commissions for its collection were issued on 21 June.  The names of the collectors were to be certified to the Exchequer by 8 July, and the whole tenth paid in one payment, on Michaelmas 1402. The northern clergy resisted the order for collection, however, and had to be distrained to return the certificates with the collectors\' names.The total net yield of the tax is estimated at £1,476.(|A Calendar of the Register of Robert Waldby, Archbishop of York, 1397|, ed.

942,1393 June 2 - 25 ,subsidies granted by the communities of Carmarthenshire and ,Richard II ,"Presumably due to his poor relationship with many within the ruling classes, and the conditions often placed by the parliaments of this period upon grants of taxation, it is clear that, during the second half of his reign, Richard II was eager to exploit alternative sources of revenue, and especially sectors of the population not normally burdened with royal taxation.  In the winter of 1389-90, a subsidy of 1000 marks had been levied in north Wales, and another of 2000 marks was raised from the men of Cheshire in the autumn of 1391, both areas generally beyond the scope of the traditional fifteenth and tenth.  Rees also notes that the king also attempted to include the lordship of Gower, then in royal hands, in taxation, stating that \'a special sessions (called to assemble the freemen to request a subsidy from them) was referred to as a \'Parliament\' in the Gower charter\' (p 66 and p 67 note 2).Wales was clearly an area of potential for the levying of royal lay taxation, but although such levies may have helped to ease the burdens on the English Exchequer, as Tuck states (p 194) this scarcely had the effect of creating loyalty among Richard\'s Welsh subjects. In fact the opposite was probably true, since there is ample evidence of unrest in various parts of Wales during this time, and, as R.R. Davies describes (p 439), Wales in the late fourteenth century \'was still held firmly in the vice of a ruthlessly exploitative lordship ... in Principality and Marcher lordships alike\'.Little is known of the processes by which the counties of Carmarthenshire and Cardiganshire granted Richard a subsidy of around £1000 in the summer of 1393, but another similar subsidy of around the same amount was to be levied from Anglesey and Caernarfonshire in 1395, and surviving documents state that those subsidies were granted in the great sessions (SC 6/1215/6). The 1393 subsidies, granted separately by the communities of each county (on 2 June by Carmarthenshire and on 25 June by Cardiganshire), were each to be collected in five annual instalments, payable on 14 September, and details of some the collectors for the various commotes have been collated by Griffiths.  Financial details of these grants can be found in summary form in the surviving accounts of the Chamberlain of South Wales and in more detail in surviving accounts of Geoffrey Bluet, the under-chamberlain of South Wales who acted as the receiver of the subsidy in both counties.  Information for all but one of the five collections is extant, as follows:1st collection - none surviving2nd collection - SC 6/1222/6 m 2 (Chamberlain\'s account)/E 179/242/61 (under-chamberlain\'s account for subsidy)3rd collection - SC 6/1222/7 m 9 (Chamberlain\'s account, summary of subsidy account only)4th collection - SC 6/1222/8 m 8 (Chamberlain\'s account, summary of subsidy account only)5th collection - no surviving Chamberlain\'s account/E 101/511/24 mm 6-6d (under-chamberlain\'s account for subsidy)Arrears as at 29 September 1399 for Cardiganshire may be found at SC 6/1159/14 m 1.A.

950,1398 Oct 27 ,free gift of half a tenth from the clergy of Sussex ,Richard II ,"On 27 October 1398 the clergy of the county of Sussex met together in the church of St. John Southover, Lewes, and granted a \'free gift\' to Richard II, to be levied as a half a tenth of their spiritualities and temporalities.Little is known of this gift or the reasons that lay behind it, but it was perhaps intended to buy the king\'s favour during the period of his \'tyranny\' in which he exacted revenge against those who had supported the Lords Appellant against him in 1389. As the county in which the earl of Arundel, who was executed for his part in September 1397, had had his seat, at Arundel Castle, perhaps its clergy had a particular need to secure Richard\'s good will. On the other hand, the bishop of Chichester, Robert Rede, was a firm favourite of the king and had travelled to Ireland with him in 1394. It is also possible, therefore, that the \'gift\' was a gesture of support.The only source of information about this grant is a receipt in the E 179 series (E 179/363/151). This document reveals that the dean of Chichester Cathedral, Master John de Maydenhethe, had been appointed receiver of this tax, and on 21 December 1398 he acknowledged receipt at Chichester of £69 2s.8d. from the prior of Sele, who was the collector of the tax in the deaneries of Lewes and Dallington.(E 179/363/151) ",Origin  Granted,

Other groups, such as royal pensioners, were also assessed to pay 3s in the pound of pensions over £20 per annum.  A sliding scale of payments was to be levied on peers, ecclesiastics, merchants and others.  All other persons were to pay 1s, with some exceptions (|Stat.

632,1698 July 5 ,quarterly poll tax ,William and Mary ,"A bill for a poll tax for one year, payable in quarterly instalments was introduced into the Commons on 14 April 1698; it was passed by the Commons on 15 June and by the Lords eight days later; it received the royal assent at the close of the session on 5 July (|Journal of the House of Commons| XII, |1697-9|, 313, 329; Cobbett, |Hist. Parl.|, 1182).Every person \'of what age, sex or condition soever\' within the kindgom was to contribute one shilling at each of the four payment dates. Children under the age of sixteen, paupers, day-labourers and household servants and those who had four or more children and did not have goods or lands to the value of £50 were exempt. Moreover, gentleman woth more than £300 per annum. wealthy widows and unmarried women worth more than £1,000 per annum were to contribute a further 20s. Further portions of the act detailed additional occupations and persons who were to pay extra. Peers and bishops were assessed at different times and required to pay £10 a quarter. The commissioners for this tax were those who were appointed for the previous grant of supply, an act granting £1,484,015 1s 11&#190;d for the disbandment of forces (9 Will III, c. 10). Payments dates to the commissioners were set and have been included as the payment date here. The money was to paid into the Exchequer by: 20 September 1698; 20 December that year; 20 March 1699; and 20 June 1699.The Act spelt out the charges which the grant was to meet, principally the costs of naval forces. It also allowed individuals or corporations to make loans to the crown, not exceeding £500,000, on the security of the tax revenue. The receipts of this Poll Tax were to be kept separately to facilitate the repayment of such loans, and several provisions in the Act dealt with the administration of the loans and their repayment from the tax at the Exchequer (9 Will III, c. 38; |Stat. of the Realm|, VII, 411-20).Although no documents for this tax for Pembrokeshire survive among the records of TNA series E 179, an assessment for High Street, St. Mary\'s and Dew Street wards and another for Market Street and St. Thomas\' wards, Haverfordwest, explicitly for this grant are in Pembrokeshire Record Office, ref.

634,1689 May 10 or later ,income tax of 12d. in the pound ,William and Mary ,"In its first session, the Convention Parliament (which was deemed to have begun on 13 February 1689) granted \'An act for a grant to their majesties of an aid of 12d. in the pound for one year for the necessary defence of the realm\' (1 Wm.&amp; M., c.20 (|Stat. Realm.|, VI, pp 77-85). The order for this bill was issued by the commons on 10 May (|Parl. Hist.|, v, p 253). This act instituted what was, in principle, an income tax. Every person and corporate body was to pay, for one year, 12d. in the pound according to the yearly profit of their personal estate (excluding debts, stock on lands, and household items); namely (the act says) 6s. in the pound for every hundred pounds\' worth of such property. The yearly value of such property was therefore to be calculated at a fixed rate of 30s. on every hundred pounds of its actual value (namely, 3%). Public officers (military and navy officers excepted) paid the same rate of 12d. in the pound upon their annual fees and profits.A charge for a year at the same rate was also levied upon the yearly value of lands and profits from land. The yearly value was stated to be the amount the property would be worth if leased at a rack-rent, and the present rent was not to be used as a basis for assessment if it had been subject to certain reductions, such as allowances in respect of repairs, taxes, and parish duties. (A &#8216;rack-rent&#8217; in this context must mean one \'equal ... to the full [yearly] value of the land\' (|OED|, 2nd edn., xiii, 83).) On the other hand, allowances are to be made in respect of lands charged with fee-farm rents and similar rents.The commissioners to be appointed for this act were to meet before 3 September to divide themselves within their jurisdictions, and then appoint assessors for the parishes. The assessments were to be returned to the commissioners by 12 October, and a copy of the assessments was to be delivered into the Exchequer by 25 November, or within thirty days after. A further act relating to the appointment of commissioners for this tax followed (1 Wm. &amp; M., c.31 (|Stats. Realm.|, VI, p 95).The money was to be collected and paid into the Exchequer in two instalments, due respectively on 1 December 1689 and 1 March 1690, or within thirty days after.Although no documents for this tax for Glamorgan survive among the records of TNA series E 179, a form of a warrant to the chief constables of the hundred of Newcastle, Glamorgan, to elect assessors for this tax, is in the National Library of Wales, ref.

636,1689 Dec 16 ,income tax of 3s. in the pound (aid of 2s and additional aid ,William and Mary ,"On 13 February 1689 the Convention which had been meeting since 22 January resolved to turn itself into a Parliament, and on 16 December the king gave his assent to &#8216;An act for a grant to their majesties of an aid of two shillings in the pound for one year&#8217; (2 Wm.&amp; M., sess. 2, c.1 (Stat. Realm, vi, 104-142)). The tax was said to be granted \'for the necessary defence of [the realm], for the reducing of Ireland, and for the vigorous prosecution of the war against France both by sea and land\'.Upon presenting the bill, the speaker noted its unusual length and commented that since \'great abuses had been committed in assessing the late supply of the like nature, [the commons] have endeavoured to provide against those abuses in raising of this present tax\'.The provisions of this tax are similar to those of the previous income tax. The rate was raised however to 2s. in the pound, and money and debts (except those adjudged to be desperate) were to be included in the assessment. This tax was asserted to be the equivalent of 12s. on every hundred pounds of money or hundred pounds&#8217; worth of personal estate. In effect, therefore, the yearly value of such property was calculated to be 6% of the actual value, double the previous rate. The rate of 2s. was also levied on public officers (military and navy officers excepted) and land as before.The commissioners appointed to assess and collect the tax are listed in the Act. They were to meet and divide their respective jurisdictions among themselves by 5 February 1690. Warrants were to be issued by them appointing two assessors within each parish, township, or other place, who were to certify the value of the taxable property to the commissioners by the 19 February, unless the commissioners thought it fit to give them further time. Duplicates of these certificates were sent to the receivers general and head collectors; and one extract of all the certificates for the particular hundred or similar jurisdiction was to be compiled and transmitted to the Exchequer before 17 March.The tax was to be paid into the Exchequer in four quarterly payments; namely by 25 March, 24 June, 29 September, and 25 December, or within twenty days after each of these dates.The act includes provisoes exempting various bodies, such as university colleges, from assessment, and those lending money upon the security of the act would receive interest of 7% per annum upon their loan.A subsequent act (1 Wm.&amp; M., sess. 2 , c.5, |Stat. Realm, VI, pp. 149-151) added a further rate of 12d. in the pound without affecting the details of the assessment and collection, and the taxes imposed by these two acts were therefore dealt with together as if a single grant of 3s. in the pound had been made. The surviving records reflect this. ", ,"1st: 1690 March 25, 2nd: 1690 June 24, 3rd: 1690 Sept 29, 4th: 1690 Dec 25"

On 7 April it passed the Commons; 11 April the Lords; and 16 April received the royal assent.The Act required those over sixteen and not paupers to contribute one shilling at each of the four payment dates: 1 June, 1 September and 1 December 1694, and 1 March 1695. Those who had estates valued at between £300 and £600 per annum were required to pay 10s and those over £600 20s. There were special terms for lawyers, the clergy, merchants and other named groups.The commissioners for each county were those appointed for the Act 4 William &amp; Mary, c. 1. They were to meet on 2 May and complete their assessments by 18 May. These were to be certified to the Exchequer by 2 July in the form of \'a true duplicate of the whole sum charged\'.

On 24 February 1692 it received the royal assent.The Act required those over sixteen and not paupers to contribute one shilling at each of the four payment dates: 3 May, 3 August, 3 November 1692 and 3 February 1693. Men who had estates valued above £300, unmarried women with estates worth over £1,000, and widows with estates worth over £100 per annum, or £1,000 in total, were to pay 20s. There were special terms for lawyers, the clergy, merchants and other named groups.The commissioners for each county were those appointed for the Act 3 William &amp; Mary, c. 5. They were to meet on 16 March 1692 and complete their assessments by 6 April. These were to be certified to the Exchequer by 3 June in the form of \'a true duplicate of the whole sum charged\'. It was provided that, should the revenue generated by this tax not reach the sum of £1,341,700, then the deficiency should be made up by a loan, repayable from the proceeds of the next Aid (|Statutes of the Realm|, VI, 302-8; |Journal of the House of Commons|, X, 672, 693). An assessment for Huntingdonshire, for the third quarterly payment, is E 179/249/3. It was delivered into the Exchequer on 24 November 1692.On account of difficulties in collection, a further Act, the \'Act for the review of the Quarterly Poll granted to their majesties in the last session of this present Parliament\' was passed in the same Parliament (|Statutes of the Realm|, vol VI, pp.399-400).  No specific mention of the passing of this Act may be ascertained; however royal assent was given \'to various public and private bills\' on 14 March 1693, before the Parliament was prorogued until 2 May.

A communal assessment for Wormelow hundred, Herefordshire (E 179/119/508A), was delivered into the Exchequer on 9 September 1693, therefore, it seems likely that the Act was passed with others unspecified in March 1693.

The purposes of the grant, as set forth in the Act, were \'to Support [The] Government and Assist [Their] Majestyes for the Entire Reduceing of Ireland and Secureing the Peace of this Kingdome and Vigourously carrying on the Warr against France\'.The grant comprised a monthly aid of £137,641 18s 2d for twelve months from 25 December 1690, payable by four quarterly payments. The sums to be paid by the several counties are listed in the Act, as are the names of the commissioners to be appointed in each. The commissioners in each county were to meet together on or before 15 January 1691 to divide the county among themselves, delivering a memorandum of this division to the receiver general for the county. The dates on which the four quarterly payments were due to be made to the receiver general in each county were as follows: 25 March 1691, 24 June 1691, 29 September 1691, and 25 December 1691. The receiver generals were to convey these payments to the Exchequer within twenty days after each of these dates.During the next session of Parliament, opening on 22 October 1691, a further act was passed effectively continuing this aid for a further year. Although the statute itself does not refer explicitly to the earlier act, the 1691 grant appears to have been treated as a continuation of the earlier tax, being referred to as the \'second twelve months\' payment\' (E 179/252/29 m 3). Again, the tax was payable in four quarterly instalments, on 25 March 1692, 24 June 1692, 29 September 1692 and 25 December 1692. The terms and conditions of the 1691 grant appear to have been the same as for that of 1690.Although no material for this tax for Glamorgan exists among the records of TNA series E 179, papers including a list of assessors for Newcastle hundred, for this and possibly other taxes of the same period are in the National Library of Wales, ref.

468,1696 Nov 17 or later ,"aid of land tax, several subsidies and other duties ",William III ,"This comprehensive grant was made in the second session of the Parliament of William III\'s eighth regnal year.  Cobbett gives no specific date, but summarises the debates held in that session over the problem of the revenue, which commenced on 17 November 1696.  The assessment year was to commence from 25 January.The first element of the tax was a poll tax on every person regardless of age, sex or condition, except those in receipt of alms, and the wives and children under 16 of those whose incomes were so low that they only paid this element of the tax grant.  These individuals were each to pay the tax in thirteen instalments of 4d., at twenty-eight day intervals, commencing on 22 February 1697, and amounting to a total of 4s.4d. per person.The second element was a graduated income tax.a. With the exception of day labourers, all servants and journeymen receiving wages of £4-8 per annum were to pay thirteen instalments, on the same payment dates as (1), of 1d. per £1, thus amounting to a rate of 1s.1d. per £1.b. Individuals as in (a) receiving wages of £8-16 per annum were each to pay thirteen instalments, on the same payment dates as (1), of 2d. per £1, thus amounting to a rate of 2s.2d. per £1.c. Individuals as in (a) receiving wages of over £16 were to pay thirteen instalments, on the same payment dates as (1), of 4d. per £1, thus amounting to a rate of 4s. 4d. per £1.d. Anyone in receipt of payments (annuities, stipends, pensions etc) from public funds was to pay thirteen instalments on the same payment dates as (1) of 4d. per £1, thus amounting to a rate of 4s.4d. per £1. The same rates and conditions applied to officers of state, judges, clerks in Chancery and the Exchequer, and officials employed by the church or state if they were in receipt of salaries, fees, perquisites, allowances, etc. This rate was also payable by members of the legal profession not included in the last category.The third element was a property tax.a. Personal estates either in money or debts owed to the taxpayer, securities etc, were assessed proportionately at 25s for every £100 (ie a farthing for each £1). This sum was to be paid in twelve monthly payments of 2s.1d., commencing on 25 February 1697.b. Wholesale and retail traders were to pay £2 10s for every £100 of stock (proportionately, a halfpenny per £1) in twelve monthly payments of 4s.2d., on the same dates as (3a).The fourth element was a tax on grazing land. a. All landowners and farmers with grazing land, even if the animals grazing it (cows, oxen, bullocks, sheep, pigs or horses) were not their own, were to pay 12s for every £100 of land (proportionately, 1s per £1) in twelve monthly payments on the same dates as (3a).b. All owners or holders of lands, tenements or hereditaments valued at over £1 were to pay 3s per £1. These included previously exempt property such as mines, saltmines, warrens, coppices and fishing tithes and tolls. Twelve monthly payments of 3d, on the same dates as (3a) applied. Those whose land was encumbered with rent charges and annuities were to receive deductions. Double rates were payable by Catholics, suspected Catholics and anyone else who refused to take oaths of allegiance to William III. Catholics who took the oaths within 10 days of the county commissioners\' first meeting before 2 or more of the commissioners, were not liable for the double payment. Quakers, however, because of religious objections to oath-taking, were permitted to make a ,declaration of Fidelity\'. Anyone who advanced money to the crown on the security of this act was to receive interest of 8%. Parents were liable to pay for defaulting children, and masters and mistresses for defaulting servants. Commissioners were to meet in each county on or before 20 February 1697, divide themselves, and appoint suitable persons (bailiffs, constables etc) as assessors and sub-collectors. These could be fined £2-5 if they refused to serve, but were to be remunerated at the rate of 4d for every £1 collected. Local assessments had to be returned to the commissioners by 5 March, set out in columns so that the different liabilities of each taxpayer were clear. The amounts of the sums due were to be notified to the Exchequer by 10 March. In each county a receiver-general was responsible for the overall collection and accounting of the various payments. In the following session of parliament (on 9 February 1697, according to Cobbett, the land tax element of this grant was extended for a further twelve-month period (|Stat. Realm, VII, pp 166-189, 259-266).E 179/129/768, the Kent account of the Receiver-General of this tax, demonstrates that the tax was difficult to collect thoroughly or efficiently.  The final payment recorded in the account was made on 31 October 1701, over two years late.  There are long lists of taxpayers who had defaulted on payment, and the list of sub-collectors who were said still to be in possession of sums which they should have handed over is enormously long, and the sums amount to over £900.  Apparently the receiver had given up any hope of collecting these outstanding amounts, and had issued certificates concerning these matters which were in an accompanying bag of particulars.  This bag is no longer with the document and it is not known whether it has survived.Although no assessments for this tax for Glamorgan survive among the records of TNA series E 179, papers relating to this tax including assessments, are in the National Library of Wales, ref. Penrice and Margam 6629, 6647-8.  A petition to Parliament relating to this grant for Anglesey, is in the National Library of Wales, ref.

When the grant was made is not clear, but the grant of the extension of the land tax of the previous parliament, which is included in the Act, was said by Cobbett to have been made on 9 February 1698.The import duty was imposed on a wide variety of goods for a period of 2 years 9 months. Among the items to be taxed were French wines, drugs, spices, silks, tobacco and sugar.  On many of them, however, the tax was refundable if they were exported again within 12 months.  The rates payable varied widely (but are given in the statute), and merchants who were not native to the country paid more than did native merchants (|Stat. Realm|, VII, pp 259-266). ", ,

This question received much attention from both Houses over the succeeding months, and, while remedies for the reform of the coinage were suggested, including barring the currency of clipped coin, it was also decided to raise a sum not exceeding £1,200,000 to make good the deficiency in the coinage consequent on this practice. The \'Act for granting his Majesty several rates or duties upon houses for making good the deficiency of the clipped money\' received the royal assent on 10 April 1696.The Act established a tax which was to run for seven years, from 25 March 1696. Two equal payments were to be made in each year, on 25 March and 29 September, the first payment being due on 29 September 1696: a basic rate of 2s. was to be charged for every house standing or built in that period (excluding cottages), with an additional rate of 4s. for a house having between ten and twenty windows, or of 8s. for a house having twenty or more windows.Commissioners for the first year were to be those named in the earlier Act for granting his Majesty an aid of four shillings in the pound for carrying on the war against France (see |Stat. of the Realm|, VII, 9-48). For the remainder of the term of this grant, justices of the peace were to take over.It is stated in the Act that certificates of assessment were to be with the commissioners by 4 June 1696: later assessment dates are not specified, though the procedure for producing new assessments annually is detailed, and was to be begun within ten days from the end of each year of the term of the grant (|Stat. of the Realm|, VII, 87, 89).(|Stat. of the Realm|, VII, 86-94; |Journal of the House of Commons|, 1693-7, 339, 334, 363, 364, 370, 555 etc.) ",Origin  Granted,"1st: 1696 Sept 29, 2nd: 1697 March 25, 3rd: 1697 Sept 29, 4th: 1698 March 25, 5th: 1698 Sept 29, 6th: 1699 March 25, 7th: 1699 Sept 29, 8th: 1700 March 25, 9th: 1700 Sept 2910th: 1701 March 2511th: 1701 Sept 2912th: 1702 March 2513th: 1702 Sept 291, 4th: 1703 March 25"
