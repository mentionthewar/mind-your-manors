<strong>England's Immigrants</strong> (1330-1550) is a database of 64,000 migrants to England <a href="https://www.englandsimmigrants.com/">documented here</a>.

The <strong>English Monastic database</strong> connects (among other things) monastic houses such as abbeys with the manors they owned. More information about the dataset is <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/library/digital-collections/collections/monastic">here</a>

<strong><a href="https://www.envidat.ch/dataset/digitizing-historical-plague">Digitizing historical plague</a></strong> provides time and place data for a large range of (British and International) plague outbreaks. The dataset incldes outbreaks beyond the medieval period.

Information on <strong>medieval taxes</strong> extracted from the E 179 database of Exchequer records held at The National Archives

### Online elsewhere

The <strong>Manorial Documents Register</strong> is a comprehensive listing of English and Welsh manors (...with a handful of counties yet to go online). It is searchable and downloadable <a href="https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/manor-search">via Discovery</a> and Wikidata (<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q105779874">example here</a>).

<strong><a href="https://opendomesday.org/">Open Domesday</a></strong> is a free and open version of Domesday Book <a href="https://www.opendomesday.org./api">with an API</a>. The API will return manors for a given <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_division)">hundred</a> and manors near given coordinates.

<strong><a href="https://inquisitionspostmortem.ac.uk">Inquistions Post Mortem</a></strong> is a database of these documents focusing on listing the lands of recently deceased wealthy individuals known or believed to hold lands granted by the crown. <a href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/help-with-your-research/research-guides/inquisitions-post-mortem">More about these documents is here</a>. The site indexes <a href="https://inquisitionspostmortem.ac.uk/view/place/52650">by place</a> and by person. Many of the individuals listed under a manor may simply have had the inquisition heard there - it does not mean they hold that manor.

<strong><a href="https://www.british-history.ac.uk/search/series/vch">Victoria County History</a></strong> is an extraordinary collection of information about British places through time. A lot of useful information about the owners of manors and events in them (<a href="https://wwww.british-history.ac.uk/vch/warks/vol4/pp126-131">example here</a>) often listed under the parish. But information on many other sites is also present - for example <a href="https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/yorks/vol3/pp107-112">abbeys and their abbots</a>.

The <strong>Fine Rolls</strong> record payments to the crown for permissions or privileges, such as the right to inherit, marry or secure land or establish a fair or market. Transcripts covering the reign of Henry III (much of the 13th century) are <a href="https://finerollshenry3.org.uk/home.html">transcribed and searchable here</a>. Plenty of manors get a mention.

The <strong><a href="https://archbishopsregisters.york.ac.uk/home_page/index">York Archbishop's Registers</a></strong> database also contains good quality descriptions of the wheelings, dealings, cases and decisions of the Archbishop. These might involve land deals, licences to do various things or criminal cases.

<strong><a href="https://www.dhi.ac.uk/taxatio/forms">Taxatio</a></strong> is a database of taxes paid by churches in 1291/2. It is arranged by place. <a href="https://www.dhi.ac.uk/taxatio/benkey?benkey=YK.ER.HL.27">This entry, for instance, is for Hornsea</a>, a parish overlapping the manor owned by St Mary's Abbey, York. Entries contain grid references.

The <strong><a href="https://archives.history.ac.uk/gazetteer/gazweb2.html">Gazetteer of markets and fairs</a></strong> lists around 2,400 places in England and Wales which had a market or fair by 1516. The data is not very structured (<a href="https://archives.history.ac.uk/gazetteer/gazweb2.html">here is the entry for the county of Yorkshire</a>) but it contains dates of when rights were granted (and by and to who) and when fairs happened (e.g. for Hornsea, St Nicholas Fair and a fair for the feast of St Peter's Chains)

<strong>Bridges of Medieval England to c.1250</strong>. Dataset of georeferenced medieval bridges <a href="https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/medbridges_lt_2019/downloads.cfm?archive=GIS">downloadable here</a>. The King could grant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontage">pontage</a>, the right to levy a tax to pay for building or repairing a bridge (see an <a href="https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C12217085">example described here</a>).
  
## Medieval glossary

Manorial and medieval documents can include quite a few unfamiliar words connected with land, the law, agriculture and many (many) different kinds of tax or fine.

Marina Georgiou and Farah Yameen have brought together <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lo3pZFdwqrZQ28yydLNOe7__xlUz6RlxO9KxvhB0NOY/edit?usp=sharing">many online glossaries for these terms in one place</a>.

If you find yourself looking up a term that is not on this list, please consider adding it and the definition so everyone at the event can benefit from your new knowledge.
